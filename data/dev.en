you know , one of the intense pleasures of travel and one of the delights of ethnographic research is the opportunity to live amongst those who have not forgotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in stones polished by rain , taste it in the bitter leaves of plants .
just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way , or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning , or that in the Himalaya , the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma , is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices that our lineage made , albeit successfully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive imperatives .
we 're all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initiation rites .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what 's interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya , the curandero in the mountains of the Andes , or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara -- this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma , Everest , the goddess mother of the world .
all of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the myriad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life that envelops the planet , and is as important to the well-being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an Ethnosphere , and you might define the Ethnosphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , intuitions brought into being by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness .
the Ethnosphere is humanity 's great legacy .
it 's the symbol of all that we are and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species .
and just as the biosphere has been severely eroded , so too is the Ethnosphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biologists , for example , would dare suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario in the realm of biological diversity -- scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario in the realm of cultural diversity .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it 's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an old-growth forest of the mind , a watershed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of those 6,000 languages , as we sit here today in Monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
they 're no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they 're already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
and I know there 's some of you who say , " Well , wouldn 't it be better , wouldn 't the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? " and I say , " Great , let 's make that language Yoruba . let 's make it Cantonese .
let 's make it Kogi . "
and you 'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
and so , what I 'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the Ethnosphere , a brief journey through the Ethnosphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say " different ways of being , " I really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon , the people of the anaconda who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
now , this is a people who cognitively do not distinguish the color blue from the color green because the canopy of the heavens is equated to the canopy of the forest upon which the people depend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called " linguistic exogamy : " you must marry someone who speaks a different language .
and this is all rooted in the mythological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spoken because of intermarriage , you never hear anyone practicing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with , the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador , an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air 8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and concluded that these were calling cards from the devil , so they speared the five missionaries to death .
but the Waorani didn 't just spear outsiders .
they speared each other .
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other .
we traced genealogies back eight generations , and we found two instances of natural death and when we pressured the people a little bit about it , they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we speared him anyway .
but at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge of the forest that was astonishing .
their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early ' 80s , I had a really astonishing assignment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Haiti , infiltrating the secret societies which were the foundation of Duvalier 's strength and Tonton Macoutes , and securing the poison used to make zombies .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun . and Voodoo is not a black magic cult .
on the contrary , it 's a complex metaphysical worldview .
it 's interesting .
if I asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism , whatever .
there 's always one continent left out , the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa had no religious beliefs . well , of course , they did and Voodoo is simply the distillation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era .
but , what makes Voodoo so interesting is that it 's this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water , responding to the rhythm of the dance to momentarily displace the soul of the living , so that for that brief shining moment , the acolyte becomes the god .
that 's why the voodooists like to say that " You white people go to church and speak about God .
we dance in the temple and become God . "
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be harmed ?
so you see these astonishing demonstrations : voodoo acolytes in a state of trance handling burning embers with impunity , a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that bears it when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation .
now , of all the peoples that I 've ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia .
descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia , in the wake of the conquest , these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain .
in a bloodstained continent , these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish .
to this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
the young acolytes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years : two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation they spend in their natural mother 's womb ; now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are inculturated into the values of their society , values that maintain the proposition that their prayers and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initiation , one day they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise . and in that crystal moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes of the stunningly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is affirmed in stunning glory . and the priest steps back and says , " You see ? it 's really as I 've told you .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . "
they call themselves the " elder brothers " and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape , we either invoke Rousseau and the old canard of the " noble savage , " which is an idea racist in its simplicity , or alternatively , we invoke Thoreau and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
there 's not a lot of room for either in the malarial swamps of the Asmat or in the chilling winds of Tibet , but they have , nevertheless , through time and ritual , forged a traditional mystique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it , but on a far subtler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist because it is breathed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the Andes who 's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
whether it 's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
what 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw and the Crooked Beak of Heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world , spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
it 's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman 's repertoire .
what makes ayahuasca fascinating is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the elaboration of it . it 's made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woody liana which has in it a series of beta-carbolines , harmine , harmaline , mildly hallucinogenic -- to take the vine alone is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke drift across your consciousness -- but it 's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family called Psychotria viridis .
this plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines , very close to brain serotonin , dimethyltryptamine , 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you 've ever seen the Yanomami blowing that snuff up their noses , that substance they make from a different set of species also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
to have that powder blown up your nose is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity .
it doesn 't create the distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
in fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes -- who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era with his discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s -- I used to argue that you couldn 't classify these tryptamines as hallucinogenic because by the time you 're under the effects there 's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally because they 're denatured by an enzyme found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase .
they can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction with some other chemical that denatures the MAO .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary to potentiate the tryptamine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants , do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants that when combined in this way , created a kind of biochemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great euphemism , " trial and error , " which is exposed to be meaningless .
but you ask the Indians , and they say , " The plants talk to us . "
well , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest , all of which are referable to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , " I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don 't you know anything ? " and I said , " No . "
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
now , that 's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting than counting stamens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people view them as quaint and colorful but somehow reduced to the margins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn 't change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux when they gave up the bow and arrow any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the horse and buggy .
it 's not change or technology that threatens the integrity of the Ethnosphere . it is power , the crude face of domination .
wherever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away ; these are dynamic living peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt to : whether it 's the egregious deforestation in the homeland of the Penan -- a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , from Sarawak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution on the banks of the rivers , where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away to the South China Sea , where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest -- or , in the case of the Yanomami , it 's the disease entities that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research recently , you 'll see it 's a crude face of political domination .
you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a people is universally condemned , but ethnocide , the destruction of people 's way of life , is not only not condemned , it 's universally , in many quarters , celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of Tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa with a young colleague , and it was only when I got to Lhasa that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes , 1.2 million people killed by the cadres during the Cultural Revolution .
this young man 's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the Chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora that took the people to Nepal .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
he was smuggled into the jail at the age of two to hide beneath her skirt tails because she couldn 't bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that brave deed was put into an education camp .
one day she inadvertently stepped on an armband of Mao , and for that transgression , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear , but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards this blandly amorphous generic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduced to a more narrow modality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having forgotten there were even other possibilities .
and it 's humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for [ 150,000 ] years .
the Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed ; the poetry of the shaman was displaced by the prose of the priesthood ; we created hierarchy specialization surplus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
now , that shallow history doesn 't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
when these myriad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it 's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens find a way to flourish . and there are great moments of optimism .
this is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people , and this man , Olayuk , told me a marvelous story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government has not always been kind to the Inuit people , and during the 1950s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
this old man 's grandfather refused to go .
the family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the runners of their sleds were originally made of fish wrapped in caribou hide .
so , this man 's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
he simply slipped outside , pulled down his sealskin trousers and defecated into his hand . and as the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of a blade .
he put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife and as it finally froze solid , he butchered a dog with it .
he skinned the dog and improvised a harness , took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled , harnessed up an adjacent dog , and disappeared over the ice floes , shit knife in belt .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
the Canadian government in April of 1999 gave back to total control of the Inuit an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
it 's our new homeland . it 's called Nunavut .
it 's an independent territory . they control all mineral resources .
an amazing example of how a nation-state can seek restitution with its people .
and finally , in the end , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who 've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they 're not remote at all .
they 're homelands of somebody .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
so , what we 're trying to do at the National Geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
we think that polemics -- -- we think that polemics are not persuasive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and so we are probably the best storytelling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
156 nations carry our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and what we 're doing is a series of journeys to the Ethnosphere where we 're going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away dazzled by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embrace gradually , one by one , the central revelation of anthropology : that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where all of the wisdom of all peoples can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you very much .
what I 'm going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is Seadragon , and it 's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
we 're looking at many , many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in , panning through the thing , rearranging it in any way we want .
and it doesn 't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it 's in the 300 megapixel range .
it doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flexible architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-image data .
this is " Bleak House " by Dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove to you that it 's really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real representation of the text ; it 's not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-book .
I wouldn 't recommend it .
this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of The Guardian .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium .
we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian .
we 've made up a fake ad that 's very high resolution -- much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we 've embedded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
we hope that this means no more pop-ups and other kind of rubbish like that -- shouldn 't be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one I really won 't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the U.S.
superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image .
so let 's pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called Photosynth , which really marries two different technologies .
one of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by Noah Snavely , a graduate student at the University of Washington , co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the Web . it 's powered by Seadragon .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience .
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
the computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken . so you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging , and these things have all been related spatially .
I 'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
I would like to jump straight to one of Noah 's original data-sets -- and this is from an early prototype of Photosynth that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind this technology , the Photosynth technology . and it 's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we 've put up on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr . you just type Notre Dame into Flickr , and you get some pictures of guys in t-shirts , and of the campus and so on . and each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model .
and so these are all Flickr images , and they 've all been related spatially in this way .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
you know , I never thought that I 'd end up working at Microsoft .
it 's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it 's everything from cell phone cameras to professional SLRs , quite a large number of them , stitched together in this environment .
and if I can , I 'll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visually , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that 's greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emerges of the entire Earth .
think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler 's Virtual Earth work .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered .
if somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are , then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data , and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space , into that meta-verse , using everybody else 's photos , and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way .
and of course , a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do I understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
Yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
it 's creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phrases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of richness that comes out of that is really huge . it 's a classic network effect .
Blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
thanks so much .
I 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you 've already heard , and I 'll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
I want to start with what I call the " official dogma . "
the official dogma of what ?
the official dogma of all western industrial societies .
and the official dogma runs like this : if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens , the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worthwhile , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
this , I think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn 't occur to anyone to question it .
and it 's also deeply embedded in our lives .
I 'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about salad dressing .
175 salad dressings in my supermarket , if you don 't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings , in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers , CD player , tape player , tuner , amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
we can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you 've got to admit that 's a lot of choice .
in other domains -- the world of communications .
there was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma Bell .
you rented your phone . you didn 't buy it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player , nose hair trimmer , and creme brulee torch .
and if by some chance you haven 't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is " No . "
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
so , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , " Well , we could do A , or we could do B.
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " Doc , what should I do ? "
and the doc says , " A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? "
and you say , " If you were me , Doc , what would you do ? "
and the doc says , " But I 'm not you . "
and the result is -- we call it " patient autonomy , " which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely , the patient .
there 's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can 't buy them .
why do they market to us if we can 't buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
we don 't inherit an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to .
and it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less diligent .
it 's because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , " Should I get married or not ? should I get married now ?
should I get married later ? should I have kids first , or a career first ? "
all of these are consuming questions .
and they 're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are blessed , as Carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that I 'm not going to tell anybody about , where the WiFi works .
I 'm not telling you about it because I want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn 't be working .
we can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our Blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .
and even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , " Should I answer this cell phone call ?
should I respond to this email ? should I draft this letter ? "
and even if the answer to the question is " no , " it 's certainly going to make the experience of your kid 's soccer game very different than it would 've been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what 's good about it , so I 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that it produces paralysis , rather than liberation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
I 'll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
a colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard , the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces .
and what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered , rate of participation went down two percent .
you offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 funds to choose from , it 's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you 'll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don 't have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer .
by not participating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
and I think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it 's for all eternity , right ?
you don 't want to pick the wrong mutual fund , or even the wrong salad dressing .
so that 's one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , you know , what salad dressing is ? -- it 's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose .
second , what economists call " opportunity costs . "
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you 've chosen .
here 's an example . for those of you who aren 't New Yorkers , I apologize .
but here 's what you 're supposed to be thinking .
here 's this couple on the Hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? " well , damn it , " this guy is thinking , " It 's August .
everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
I could be parking right in front of my building . "
and he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terrific .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs .
here 's another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you 're choosing one thing , you 're choosing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attractive .
third : escalation of expectations .
this hit me when I went to replace my jeans .
I wear jeans almost all the time .
and there was a time when jeans came in one flavor , and you bought them , and they fit like crap , and they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
so I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and I said , you know , " I want a pair of jeans . here 's my size . "
and the shopkeeper said , " Do you want slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ?
you want button fly or zipper fly ? you want stonewashed or acid-washed ?
do you want them distressed ?
you want boot cut , you want tapered , blah blah blah ... " On and on he went .
my jaw dropped , and after I recovered , I said , " I want the kind that used to be the only kind . "
he had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and I walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had .
I did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but I felt worse .
why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
when they came in 100 flavors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect .
and what I got was good , but it wasn 't perfect .
and so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected .
adding options to people 's lives can 't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that 's going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they 're good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn 't all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , the world we live in -- we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife , and she 's really quite wonderful .
I couldn 't have done better . I didn 't settle .
but settling isn 't always such a bad thing .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available , and you buy one that is disappointing , and you ask why , who 's responsible ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them ; they blame themselves .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they 're at fault .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objectively , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all false . it is not true .
there 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn 't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there 's some magical amount . I don 't know what it is .
I 'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
now , as a policy matter -- I 'm almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff I 'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , Western societies .
and what is so frustrating and infuriating is this : Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don 't help . it 's a waste of money .
what I 'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it 's not simply that they don 't help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people 's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
this is what economists call a " Pareto-improving move . "
income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us .
so to conclude . you 're supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , " Ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this fishbowl . "
impoverished imagination , a myopic view of the world -- and that 's the way I read it at first .
the more I thought about it , however , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible , you don 't have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible , you decrease satisfaction .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
everybody needs a fishbowl .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery , and , I suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , I 've talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we 're actually starting at a new point : we 've been digitizing biology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
so , we 've always been trying to ask big questions .
" what is life ? " is something that I think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we 've tried various approaches , paring it down to minimal components .
we 've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , " Can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? "
this is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory , and we 've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we 're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthesize a chromosome ?
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of inert chemical material .
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several stages , in fact , starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthesizing DNA is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it 's a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi X174 .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E. coli .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
they laughed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome -- it 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we 'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses so we could actually vary the cassettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced this genome in 1995 , the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
we actually found , on resequencing it , 30 errors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be booted up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put watermarks in .
think of this : we have a four-letter genetic code -- A , C , G and T.
triplets of those letters code for roughly 20 amino acids , such that there 's a single letter designation for each of the amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes ; there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters , put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 72,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we 're trying to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won 't any longer grow readily in E. coli -- it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew there 's a mechanism called homologous recombination that biology uses to repair DNA that can put pieces together .
here 's an example of it : there 's an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
twelve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally desiccated ; they can live in a vacuum .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space , move around , find a new aqueous environment .
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
here 's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; yeast puts them together automatically .
this is not an electron micrograph ; this is just a regular photomicrograph .
it 's such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
this is over 580,000 letters of genetic code ; it 's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it 's over 300 million molecular weight .
if we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing , it takes 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple ; it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it 's also simpler when you go into eukaryotes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucleus and pop in another one , and that 's what you 've all heard about with cloning .
with bacteria and Archaea , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
we purified a chromosome from one microbial species -- roughly , these two are as distant as human and mice -- we added a few extra genes so we could select for this chromosome , we digested it with enzymes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell -- and you 'll appreciate our very sophisticated graphics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , adding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest DNA .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
it got expressed and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign material , chewed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed ; when we read the genetic code , it 's exactly what we had transferred in .
so , this may sound like genomic alchemy , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dramatically .
now I 've argued , this is not genesis ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and I 've argued that we 're about to perhaps create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , where there 's massive new speciation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we 're about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : I was born in 1946 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , there 'll be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it 's going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billion-plus barrels of oil -- that 's a hundred million barrels a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there 's all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electronics industry only had a dozen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we 're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we 're calling combinatorial genomics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it 's just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don 't know necessarily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we 're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
you 've seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
we have second- and third-generation fuels that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much higher-value fuels like octane or different types of butanol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock , and so we 're working with designing cells to go down this road .
and we think we 'll have the first fourth-generation fuels in about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
it takes CO2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we 're looking to see if we can take captured CO2 , which can easily be piped to sites , convert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of " What is life ? "
we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry -- Yeah . if you can 't do that at TED , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
here 's what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , speeding up evolution with synthetic bacteria , Archaea and , eventually , eukaryotes .
we 're a ways away from improving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren 't there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference .
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it 's nothing if not ambitious .
this is the machine below Geneva .
we take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .
this is the one I work on . it 's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by ATLAS .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
it 's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
in other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
I don 't know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires .
those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , " No they don 't . they 're small wires . "
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called superconducting wire .
so at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
in one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
so the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that 's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
they 're all on their way back underground now .
by the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refute .
I think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that we 're overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege 's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this , " Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . "
thank you .
I am a writer .
writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , of course .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and I don 't expect that that 's ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
and the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this memoir called " Eat , Pray , Love " which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega-sensation , international bestseller thing .
the result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I 'm doomed .
seriously -- doomed , doomed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , " Aren 't you afraid -- aren 't you afraid you 're never going to be able to top that ?
aren 't you afraid you 're going to keep writing for your whole life and you 're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all , ever again ? "
so that 's reassuring , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same kind of , sort of fear-based reaction .
and people would say , " Aren 't you afraid you 're never going to have any success ?
aren 't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
aren 't you afraid that you 're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing 's ever going to come of it and you 're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure ? "
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
and I always have been .
and I 'm afraid of many , many more things besides that people can 't even guess at .
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that I 've been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other 's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don 't do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don 't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn 't -- that chemical engineering block John , how 's it going ?
it just didn 't come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven 't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives .
we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
and all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone , of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn 't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
Norman Mailer , just before he died , last interview , he said " Every one of my books has killed me a little more . "
an extraordinary statement to make about your life 's work , you know .
but we don 't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we 've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we 've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to anguish .
and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know -- I 'm not at all comfortable with that assumption .
I think it 's odious .
and I also think it 's dangerous , and I don 't want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
I think it 's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption , particularly given the circumstance that I 'm in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , I 'm pretty young , I 'm only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it 's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bluntly , because we 're all sort of friends here now -- it 's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh , so Jesus , what a thought !
you know that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning , and I don 't want to go there .
I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as I 've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I 've been sort of looking across time , and I 've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , O.K. ?
people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
the Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity " daemons . "
Socrates , famously , believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar .
the Romans had the same idea , but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius .
which is great , because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this , sort of magical divine entity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist 's studio , kind of like Dobby the house elf , and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I 'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn 't take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
if your work bombed , not entirely your fault , you know ?
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
and then the Renaissance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let 's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries , and there 's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine .
and it 's the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and I got to tell you , I think that was a huge error .
you know , I think that allowing somebody , one mere person to believe that he or she is like , the vessel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknowable , eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psyche .
it 's like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can 't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there 's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of , basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff .
I 'm not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel downright paranormal .
I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who 's now in her 90s , but she 's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , " run like hell . "
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her , she could collect it and grab it on the page .
and other times she wouldn 't be fast enough , so she 'd be running and running and running , and she wouldn 't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it " for another poet . "
and then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she 's running to the house and she 's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it 's going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
so when I heard that I was like -- that 's uncanny , that 's exactly what my creative process is like .
that 's not at all what my creative process is -- I 'm not the pipeline !
I 'm a mule , and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day , and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly .
but even I , in my mulishness , even I have brushed up against that thing , at times .
and I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
and for me , the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized .
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he 's speeding along , and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , elusive and tantalizing , and he wants it , you know , it 's gorgeous , and he longs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn 't have a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a pencil , he doesn 't have a tape recorder .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , " I 'm going to lose this thing , and then I 'm going to be haunted by this song forever .
I 'm not good enough , and I can 't do it . "
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , " Excuse me , can you not see that I 'm driving ? "
" do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you .
otherwise , go bother somebody else today .
go bother Leonard Cohen . "
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn 't have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
it could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite Tom .
so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when I was in the middle of writing " Eat , Pray , Love , " and I fell into one of those , sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we 're working on something and it 's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and I started to think I should just dump this project .
but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
and I said aloud , " Listen you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn 't brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don 't have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you 've got to show up and do your part of the deal .
O.K. But if you don 't do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I 'm going to keep writing anyway because that 's my job .
and I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job . "
because -- in the end it 's like this , O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa , people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until dawn .
and they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
and I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn 't doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 nights before , but everything would align .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to chant , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . "
that 's God , you know .
curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain , they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , ole , ole , " which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances .
in Spain , when a performer has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , ole , ole , Allah , magnificent , bravo , " incomprehensible , there it is -- a glimpse of God .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tricky bit comes the next morning , for the dancer himself , when he wakes up and discovers that it 's Tuesday at 11 a.m. , and he 's no longer a glimpse of God .
he 's just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he 's never going to ascend to that height again .
and maybe nobody will ever chant God 's name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn 't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you 're finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how I 've started to think , and this is certainly how I 've been thinking in the last few months as I 've been working on the book that will soon be published , as the dangerously , frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success .
and what I have to , sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that , is , don 't be afraid .
don 't be daunted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the divine , cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed , for just one moment through your efforts , then " Ole ! "
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
and " Ole ! " to you , nonetheless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
" Ole ! " to you , nonetheless , just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
Ole !
last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn 't show the thickness of the ice .
the arctic ice cap is , in a sense , the beating heart of the global climate system .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
the next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what 's happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is marked in red .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue -- that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .
in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
already in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
whoa !
she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north .
this is an annual melting river .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
that 's equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
in the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flows have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
in California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack .
this is hitting the reservoirs .
and the predictions , as you 've read , are serious .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific , from the Americas , extending westward , and on either side of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the United States is one of the two largest emitters , along with China .
and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
that image reminded me of something .
around Christmas , in my home in Tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the coal industry 's ads around Christmas was this one .
frosty the coal man is a jolly , happy soul .
he 's abundant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal .
let me be clear about it . al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
so the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn 't dirty .
we think it 's clean -- smells good , too .
so don 't worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal -- you 've heard a lot about it .
so let 's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
but that 's the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today 's clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
America is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put America back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems .
Repower America . find out more .
this is the last one .
it 's about repowering America .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investments to create high-paying jobs .
Repower America . it 's time to get real .
there is an old African proverb that says , " If you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . "
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and grasp , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my adviser Pattie , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop , what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically , arranging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Siftables .
in a nutshell , a Siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie .
they 're able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wireless radio .
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
and Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nuance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles .
so , I 'm going to start with some simple examples .
this Siftable is configured to show video , and if I tilt it in one direction , it 'll roll the video this way ; if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
so if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surrounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flustered .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we 've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mixed .
if we overshoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some neat possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here I 'm -- This is a Fibonacci sequence that I 'm making with a simple equation program .
here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle .
basically , in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable , and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it reshuffles , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , " Make words , " and they know exactly what to do .
so here 's another few people trying it out .
that 's our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive cartoon application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
and this is Felix , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he 's brought a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good job ! Yeah !
so by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- Woof !
inventing his own narrative .
Hello !
it 's an open-ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we 've built recently , in which Siftables act as sounds like lead , bass and drums .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable .
there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let 's have a look .
we 'll start by putting a lead into two sequence Siftables , arrange them into a series , extend it , add a little more lead .
now I put a bass line in .
now I 'll put some percussion in .
and now I 'll attach the filter to the drums , so I can control the effect live .
I can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
and now I 'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
I can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
so I don 't have to plan it out in advance , but I can improvise , making it longer or shorter as I go .
and now , finally , I can fade the whole sequence out using the volume Siftable , tilted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought I want to leave you with is that we 're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with " happiness " in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we 're just as messed up as anybody else is .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it but , by and large , this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : basically it 's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they 're both lumped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it 's the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well-being without distorting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way of getting it right .
now , I 'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story .
he said he 'd been listening to the symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
but it hadn 't .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it 's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , " Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? "
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it 's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , " How have you been feeling lately ? "
or " How was your trip to Albania ? " or something like that .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don 't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
I won 't go into detail . it 's no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients .
those are their recordings .
and you are asked , " Who of them suffered more ? "
and it 's a very easy question .
clearly , Patient B suffered more .
his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had Patient B had and more .
but now there is another question : " how much did these patients think they suffered ? "
and here is a surprise : and the surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
the stories of the colonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends -- and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse was the one where pain was at its peak at the very end .
it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , " How bad was the whole thing , in total ? "
and it was much worse for A than for B in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work , you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A and lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
what defines a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straightforward .
they are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated -- you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long .
which means that , you know , in a life there , are about 600 million of them .
in a month , there are about 600,000 .
most of them don 't leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and yet , some how you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth .
and how to spend it , would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they 're really quite distinct .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation .
that 's not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
for the remembering self , a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self .
time has very little impact on this story .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that 's the surgeon that will be chosen .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don 't choose between experiences .
we choose between memories of experiences .
and , even when we think about the future , we don 't think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn 't need .
I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case , that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
and this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
and when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I 've ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
and I probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question .
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so I want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that your next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you 'll get an amnesic drug so that you won 't remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it 's actually not at all obvious because , if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer .
and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vacations we do , is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self 's life ?
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it 's a completely different thing .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn 't distinguish those notions , is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being , who 've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately , the Gallup Organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences .
and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson I think that we have learned , is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn 't teach you much about how happily they 're living their life , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , oh his father is six feet tall , how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have that much uncertainty .
if I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what I 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California , if , say , you live in Ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio .
and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . I 've got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
sure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
when we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , and that 's a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , but it 's a large representative sample , below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
60,000 .
60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I 've rarely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , say for example , taxation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the UK , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it 's going to take awhile , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon , How to enhance happiness , goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
this is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
in the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this issue will , or at least should be , the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you Danny Kahneman .
I 'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired .
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I 'm writing anything , but I 'd already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word " disabled " to see what I 'd find .
let me read you the entry .
" disabled , " adjective : " crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , rundown , worn-out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid-up , done-up , done-for , done-in cracked-up , counted-out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . "
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I just I 'd just gotten past mangled , and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
you know , of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus .
I 'm thinking this must be an ancient print date , right .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980 's , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , thank God I wasn 't using a thesaurus back then .
I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when , in fact , today I 'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
so , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting .
here 's the updated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
I find the last two words under " Near Antonyms " particularly unsettling , " whole " and " wholesome . "
so , it 's not just about the words .
it 's what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it 's about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence , a person who is limited , or a person who 's empowered ?
by casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
wouldn 't we want to open doors for them instead ?
one such person , who opened doors for me , was my childhood doctor at the A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
his name is Dr. Pizzutillo .
Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr. P.
and Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors -- you know , to help build up my leg muscles .
and I hated these bands more than anything .
I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
and , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , " Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong , powerful little girl , I think you 're going to break one of those bands .
when you do break it , I 'm going to give you a hundred bucks . "
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P 's part to get me to do the exercises I didn 't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
and I have to wonder today , to what extent his vision , and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl , shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn 't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn 't caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them , not to mention social networking platforms , allow people to self-identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth , that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
the human ability to adapt , it 's an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I 'm going to make an admission .
this phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people 's questions about it , and I think I 'm starting to figure out why .
implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity , is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
and I am going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity isn 't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
it 's part of our life .
and I tend to think of it like my shadow .
sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there 's very little , but it 's always with me .
and , certainly , I 'm not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person 's struggle .
there is adversity and challenge in life , and it 's all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn 't whether or not you 're going to meet adversity , but how you 're going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt .
there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I 'm disabled .
and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability I 've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don 't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
and , most importantly , there 's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
so it 's not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
so maybe the idea I want to put out there is , not so much overcoming adversity , as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we 're less burdened by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .
to paraphrase , it 's not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives , it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from Darwin 's work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we don 't know what we 're made of .
maybe that 's what adversity gives us , a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adversity is just change that we haven 't adapted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
now , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal .
there 's common . there 's typical . there 's no normal .
and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
I don 't think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility , or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous , we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
there 's evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and , perhaps , because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community : they didn 't view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
it was summer time . I had shorts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , " Well , if it isn 't Aimee Mullins . "
and I turn around , and it 's this older man . I have no idea who he is .
and I said , " I 'm sorry , sir , have we met ? I don 't remember meeting you . "
he said , " Well , you wouldn 't remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother 's womb . "
Oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was Dr. Kean , a man I had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
an so , my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
and , because I was born without the fibula bone , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot , and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer , this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
he said to me , " I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you 've been making liar out of me ever since . "
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood , whether it was winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann medical school and Hershey medical school .
and he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life .
and Dr. Kean went on to tell me , he said , " In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . "
see , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs , I wouldn 't have hesitated for a second .
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
if you ask me today , I 'm not so sure .
and it 's because of the experiences I 've had with them , not in spite of the experiences I 've had with them .
and , perhaps , this shift in me has happened because I 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you 're off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power , the human spirit is so receptive , if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
you 're teaching them to open doors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root word " educe . "
it means , to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960 's Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .
it 's called the streaming trials . we call it tracking here in the States .
it 's separating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
and the A students get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three month period , D level students , gave them A 's , told them they were A 's , told them they were bright .
and at the end of this three month period , they were performing at A level .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the A students and told them they were D 's .
and that 's what happened at the end of that three month period .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made .
they were simply told these are the A students , these are the D students .
and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that 's been crushed doesn 't have hope .
it doesn 't see beauty .
it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
I 'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about .
and the poem is called " The God Who Only Knows Four Words . "
" every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don 'ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , come dance with me " Come dance with me .
thank you .
for some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is " something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . "
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what 's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a ...
for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other I want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
and I 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that 's been in every children 's magic book since at least the 1950s .
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s .
I 'll do it for you , and then I 'll explain it .
and then I 'll explain why I explained it .
so , here is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
I 'll get my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel . as long as I 'm squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
I 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife .
in fact it 's held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything .
Ta-da !
so , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it 's a very simple trick methodologically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I 'm going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
the reason I 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as I move around my finger shifts .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn 't count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that 's not really what this is about . right ? and then I open my hand up .
obviously it 's clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
and then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . you give the knife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study , a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
I 'm not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that 's like aspirin shaped , it 's just a round white pill , it has some certain measurable effect .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they 're sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really flipped me out .
turns out though , that that 's not even where it stops .
if you have capsules , they are more effective than tablets in any form .
a colored capsule , that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
dosage has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don 't remember the statistic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these dosages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo you 've go to the needle .
right ? a syringe with some inert -- a couple CCs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , It 's so much stronger than the white pill .
it 's a really , this graph , well I 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule , is not as good as the needle .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality .
it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the needle .
this is a seven inch hat pin. it 's very very sharp .
and I 'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
this is really my flesh . this is not Damian 's special grown flesh .
that 's my skin right there . this is not a Hollywood special effect .
I 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
if you 're queasy -- if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn 't know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I 'll do the first bad part behind it .
you 'll get to see , you can look away too if you 'd like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce .
I 'm sorry man . am I freaking you out ?
and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we 're in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
sort of .
but you can 't count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that 's one , two three , four , five .
Yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
they go , " Well , he 's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little peek .
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
Yeah , I know .
and the people in the back go , " Okay . I didn 't really see that . "
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a Hollywood special effect .
that 's my flesh , and I can twist that around .
I 'm sorry . if you 're getting queasy , look away , don 't look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , " Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
Yes , there it is .
normally now , I would take the needle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds , But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I 'm just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you 're looking forward to that . thank you very much .
I 'm Jane McGonigal . I 'm a game designer .
I 've been making games online now for 10 years .
and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , I have a plan for this , and it entails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , " That 's a lot of time to spend playing games . "
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at The Institute For The Future , it 's actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world 's most urgent problems .
in fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
I 've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that 's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so , I 'll say it again , let it sink in .
if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . I 'm serious . I am .
here 's why . this picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming .
so , he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
now , if you 're not a gamer you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here , the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism .
and the eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win .
Oh , you 've heard of that . okay . good .
so we have some gamers among us .
an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epic win .
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem-solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century .
the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
this is what I call the " I 'm Not Good At Life " face .
and this is actually me making it . can you see ? Yes . good .
this is actually me making the " I 'm Not Good At Life " face .
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD on why we 're better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and I don 't mean just good as in successful , although that 's part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but I also but I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters , inspired to collaborate and to cooperate .
and when we 're in game worlds I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment 's notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don 't feel that way .
we feel overcome .
we feel overwhelmed .
we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we 're playing games , they just don 't exist in games .
so , that 's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can 't achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-world work ?
so , I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment .
and I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is , whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it 's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can 't achieve .
but it is on the verge of what you 're capable of . so , you have to try hard .
but there is no unemployment in World of Warcraft .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands .
there is always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
it 's not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we 're there , and what we 're doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus-one strength , and plus-one intelligence .
we don 't get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when I get off this stage I 'm not going to have plus-one speaking , and plus-one crazy idea , plus-20 crazy idea .
I don 't get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it 's so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time , that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it 's just better than reality .
so , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
now , that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it 's a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first upright primate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we 're currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it 's also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we are actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
this is true . I believe this .
so , consider this really interesting statistic .
it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University .
the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games , by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read Malcom Gladwell 's new book Outliers .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it 's based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours at effortful study , at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we 're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
so , the big question is , " What exactly are gamers getting so good at ? "
because if we could figure that out we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtuoso gamers .
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade we 're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
if you don 't know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
so , I 've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
here are the four things I came up with . the first is urgent optimism .
okay . think of this as extreme self-motivation .
urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
gamers always believe that an epic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gamers don 't sit around .
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
there is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they 've beaten us badly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they 'll stay with the game until it 's over .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
blissful productivity . I love it .
you know there is a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a half-time job .
it 's because we know , when we 're playing a game , that we 're actually happier working hard , than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they 're given the right work .
finally , epic meaning .
gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions to human planetary-scale stories .
so , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective .
so , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
second biggest wiki , in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles is the World of Warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
they are building an epic story .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft .
okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing .
gamers are super-empowered hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that 's the problem that I 'm trying to solve .
there is an economist named Edward Castronova .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money , in online worlds .
and he says , " We 're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . "
and he 's an economist . so , he 's rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- I 'm a game designer ; I 'm exuberant .
but he says , that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life .
they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep 's knuckles . right ?
before we had awesome game controlers we had sheep 's knuckles .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you 're familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian , Herodotus , you might know this history .
which is the history of who invented games and why .
Herodotus says that games , particularly dice games were invented in the kingdom of Lydia during a time of famine .
apparently , there was such a severe famine , that the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games and they set up a Kingdom-wide policy .
on one day , everybody would eat .
and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games .
and on the next day they would eat .
and according to Herodotus , they passed 18 years this way , surviving through a famine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , I think , how we 're using games today .
we 're using games to escape real-world suffering .
we 're using games to get away from everything that 's broken in the real environment , everything that 's not satisfying about real life , and we 're getting what we need from games .
but it doesn 't have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn 't getting better , So , the king decided they would play one final dice game .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
they would leave Lydia , And they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could thrive .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who lead to the Roman empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus 's crazy story is actually true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we 've been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
that was the first real-time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played dice games for 18 years , we 've been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own epic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world .
so , that 's where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game-play from .
let 's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real-world problems .
now , I know you 're asking , " How are we going to solve real world problems in games ? " well , that 's what I have devoted my work to over the past few years , at The Institute For The Future .
we have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome And then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imaging epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
I 'm just going to very briefly show you three games that I 've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures .
so , this is World Without Oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage .
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it 's real , and to live your real life as if we 've run out of oil . so , when you come to the game you sign up , you tell us where you live .
and then we give you real-time news videos data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what 's not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if their is rioting .
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007 .
and we 've tracked them for the three years since .
and I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it 's good for the world , or because we are supposed to .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , " We 've run out of oil . "
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive .
most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
so , for the next world-saving game , we decided to aim higher , bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called Superstruct at The Institute For The Future .
and the premise was , a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
you know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team .
you 've got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex-convict , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said everybody is on the dream team , and it 's your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net .
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , if you Google " Superstruct " , and see .
so , finally , the last game , We 're launching it March 3rd . this is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
if you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank Institute , as a Social Innovator , class of 2010 .
working with universities all over sub-Saharan Africa , And we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
we 've got a graphic novel . we 've got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision , and resourcefulness .
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
so , I 'm going to wrap up now .
I want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we 've got all these amazing gamers , we 've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well I hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real-world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing superpowers , blissful productivity , the ability to weave a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism , and the desire for epic meaning .
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that 's my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure , that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , I say let the world-changing games begin .
thank you .
I 'm going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse , means that many years their crops won 't grow .
there will be too much rain , not enough rain .
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can 't support .
and that leads to starvation . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far , you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really , advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
the coal revolution fueled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 1900 's we 've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that 's why we have refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper -- and let 's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
if you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects .
the effects on the weather and , perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can 't adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are , there 's some uncertainty there , but not very much .
and there 's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times , do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can 't we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying we 're a 12 ft high truck trying to get under a 10 ft bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under .
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each American , it 's about 20 tons .
for people in poor countries , it 's less than one ton .
it 's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it 's been constantly going up .
it 's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors .
a little bit of multiplication .
so , you 've got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that 's going to be based on the number of people , the services each person 's using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that 's back from high school algebra , but let 's take a look .
first we 've got population .
now , the world today has 6.8 billion people .
that 's headed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this encompasses everything , the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
these are very good things , and getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it 's a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service .
do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework , and , in fact , these kids don 't , so they 're going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
now , efficiency , E , the energy for each service , here , finally we have some good news .
we have something that 's not going up .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings .
there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially , some individual services even , bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fertilizer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
and so , overall here , if we 're optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we 've gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won 't cut it .
so let 's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is , can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
and so , what we 're going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy miracles .
now , when I use the term miracle , I don 't mean something that 's impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don 't have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don 't .
this is a case where we actually have to drive full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight time line .
now , I thought , how could I really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people 's imagination here ?
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
I 'm told they don 't bite , in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
now , there 's all sorts gimmicky solutions like that one , but they don 't really add up to much .
we need solutions , either one or several , that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there 's many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I 've left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five , and we can 't give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
let 's look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it 's not , and that 's to take all the CO2 , after you 've burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long term issue .
who 's going to be sure ?
who 's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough one .
next , would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems .
cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high .
the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn 't get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it 's not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
people need to feel good about it .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , I 've grouped together .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and they actually -- although it 's great they don 't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farming , so you 're talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are intermittent sources .
the sun doesn 't shine all day , it doesn 't shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn 't blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it 's not available .
so , we 've got big cost challenges here .
we have transmission challenges .
for example , say this energy source is outside your country , you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and , finally , this storage problem .
and , to dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made , for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything , and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that 's going to be a factor of a hundred better than the approaches we have now .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you 're using .
if you 're counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we 're going to go forward on this : what 's the right approach ?
is it a Manhattan project ? what 's the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you 'll look at and say they 're crazy . that 's good .
and , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
Vinod Khosla 's investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I 'm trying to help back that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of Terrapower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium , the one percent , which is the U235 , we decided , let 's burn the 99 percent , the U238 .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it 's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material 's approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you 're burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today 's reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it 's a great thing .
it breathes this uranium as it goes along . so it 's kind of like a candle .
you can see it 's a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
I 've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
this is the left over , the 99 percent , where they 've taken out the part they burn now , so it 's called depleted uranium .
that would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by filtering sea water in an inexpensive process , you 'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it 's got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let 's think , how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let 's go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
for 2050 , you 've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture .
hopefully , we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
so , the other grade is , are we deploying this zero-emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we 're in the process of getting it elsewhere .
that 's super important .
that 's a key element of making that report card .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions .
the less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don 't get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the Al Gore book , " Our Choice " and the David McKay book , " Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . "
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
there 's a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it 's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years , I could pick who 's president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that 's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented , this is the wish I would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don 't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn 't just discuss the CO2 .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you 'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
we do need the market incentives , CO2 tax , cap and trade , something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just so I understand more about Terrapower , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we 've done , that 's only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly , then you 'll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor , finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it 's just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
that 's right . today , you 're always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong , that thing where you 're opening it up and moving things in and out .
that 's not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities .
and it just sits there and burns for the sixty years , and then it 's done .
it 's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
Yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there 's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that 's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactor .
that 's our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that 's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you 're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you 're going through this process .
but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here , where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
well , we haven 't picked a particular place , and there 's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that 's called nuclear , so we 've got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China .
I 've been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
so I 'm optimistic . you know the French and Japanese have done some work .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
it 's an important advance , but it 's like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who 's done a fast reactor , is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
well , we need , for one of these high-scale , electro-generation things that 's very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
that 's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , Terrapower , if things go well , which is wishing for a lot , could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies , we need it to be hundreds , who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
and it 's best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
in terms of big-scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you 're aware of out there ?
an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
you know , we don 't know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that 's a different approach .
there 's a liquid type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so , if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation , the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn 't work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
if you get into that situation , it 's like if you 've been over-eating , and you 're about to have a heart-attack .
then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what 's called geoengineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that 's just an insurance policy .
you hope you don 't need to do that .
some people say you shouldn 't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you 'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I 'm not sure that 's wise , given the importance of the problem , but there 's now the geoengineering discussion about , should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect .
climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they 're wrong ?
well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying there 's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there 's a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is kind of like AIDS .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later -- and a somewhat uncertain pain thing .
in fact , the IPCC report , that 's not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , okay , that isn 't that big of a deal .
the fact is it 's that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , okay , I don 't care that it doesn 't put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I 'll accept it because it 's cheaper than what 's come before .
and so , that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it 's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it 's a stupid waste of the Earth 's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
well , the actual spending on the R & amp ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it 's not that dramatic .
it shouldn 't take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that 's non-economic and you 're trying to fund that .
that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you 're very close and you 're just funding the learning curve and it 's going to get very cheap .
I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the trade-off you get into is , let 's make energy super expensive , then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even Lomborg has changed .
his shtick now is , why isn 't the R & amp ; D getting discussed more .
he 's still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skeptic camp , but he 's realized that 's a pretty lonely camp , and so , he 's making the R & amp ; D point .
and so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
the R & amp ; D piece , it 's crazy how little it 's funded .
well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say , I really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
thank you .
so , I 've known a lot of fish in my life .
I 've loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish , flavorful , textured , meaty , a best-seller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if I 'd speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability .
" absolutely , " I said .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs .
how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
it 's hard to overstate the destruction .
90 percent of large fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish , they 've collapsed .
there 's almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it .
fish farms pollute , most of them do anyway , and they 're inefficient , take tuna .
a major drawback .
it 's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
doesn 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
the day before the event I called the head of PR for the company .
let 's call him Don .
" don , " I said , " just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don 't pollute . "
" that 's right , " he said . " we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . "
and then he added , " We 're basically a world unto ourselves .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , " he said .
" best in the business . "
2.5 to one , great .
" 2.5 to one what ? what are you feeding ? "
" sustainable proteins , " he said .
" great , " I said . got off the phone .
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , " Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
he said he didn 't know . he would ask around .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company .
no one could give me a straight answer .
until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
let 's call him Don too .
" don , " I said , " what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? "
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
I said , " Chicken pellets ? "
he said , " Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . "
I said , " What percentage of your feed is chicken ? "
thinking , you know , two percent .
" well , it 's about 30 percent , " he said .
I said , " Don , what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? "
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , " there 's just too much chicken in the world . "
I fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because I 'm some self-righteous , goody-two shoes foodie .
I actually am .
no , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
this second fish , it 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
the chef had overcooked it .
like twice over .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste good after it 's been overcooked ?
I can 't , but this guy can .
let 's call him Miguel .
actually his name is Miguel .
and no , he didn 't cook the fish , and he 's not a chef .
at least in the way that you and I understand it .
he 's a biologist at Veta La Palma .
it 's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
it 's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
they did it by draining the land .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn 't make it work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
they flooded the canals .
they created a 27,000 acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel , and this company , completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm 's incredible .
I mean , you 've never seen anything like this .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
I was there not long ago with Miguel .
he 's an amazing guy , three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee .
okay ? there we are slogging through the wetlands , and I 'm panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel 's calmly conducting a biology lecture .
here , he 's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite .
now , he 's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe .
it turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , " Fish ? I didn 't know anything about fish .
I 'm an expert in relationships . "
and then he 's off launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
and don 't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
it 's great , but I was in love .
and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
so I interrupted him . I said , " Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? "
he pointed at the algae .
" I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what 's the feed conversion ratio ? "
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system , that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it 's what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it 's totally self-renewing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals ?
later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , " For a place that seems so natural , " unlike like any farm I 'd ever been at , " how do you measure success ? "
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
" that 's success , " he said .
" look at their bellies , pink .
they 're feasting . "
feasting ? I was totally confused .
I said , " Miguel , aren 't they feasting on your fish ? "
" Yes , " he said .
" we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it 's become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . "
I said , " Miguel , isn 't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? "
he shook his head , no .
he said , " We farm extensively , not intensively .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . "
okay , so let 's review .
a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn 't even be there in the first place .
they brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they 're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 .
no kidding .
I was imagining a march of the penguins thing , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , " Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? "
he looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song .
he said , " No . they do it because the food 's better . "
I didn 't mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and I don 't like fish skin .
I don 't like it seared . I don 't like it crispy .
it 's that acrid , tar-like flavor .
I almost never cook with it .
yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
he said , " The skin acts like a sponge .
it 's the last defense before anything enters the body .
it evolved to soak up impurities . "
and then he added , " But our water has no impurities . "
okay . a farm that doesn 't feed its fish .
a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and then I realized when he says , a farm that has no impurities , he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir river .
it 's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days , chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that 's literally a water purification plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I 'll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
you might say it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we 're talking about bass or beef cattle .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
but for a lot people , that 's a bit too radical .
we 're not realists , us foodies .
we 're lovers .
we love farmers ' markets .
we love small family farms .
we talk about local food .
we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will insure the future of good food , someone somewhere stands up and says , " Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? "
how are you going to feed the world ?
can I be honest ?
I don 't love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hungry today .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
no , I don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , " If we 're feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? "
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification , it 's been the business plan of American agriculture .
we should call it what it is , a business in liquidation , a business that 's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
that 's not a business , and it isn 't agriculture .
our bread basket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let 's start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , How can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don 't look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's tired .
it 's high on capital , chemistry , and machines , and it 's never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
that 's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience .
look to Miguel -- farmers like Miguel .
farms that aren 't worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
because they 're the ones that are experts in flavor too .
and if I 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better chef than I 'll ever be .
you know , I 'm okay with that , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
thank you .
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
in high school I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn 't in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking " samples , " frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water , and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , I was a real science geek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed to mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late ' 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
and I found that because there weren 't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author 's description put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
that was , the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
and an interesting thing happened , the Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday .
that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
but that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
so , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
but I didn 't let that daunt me .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I actually got certified in a pool in a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
and I didn 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , I 've spent about 3,000 hours underwater , And 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
and I 've learned that that deep ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature 's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but , when I chose a career , as an adult , it was film making .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories , with my urges to create images .
and I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , film making was the way to put pictures and stories together . and that made sense .
and of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : " Terminator , " " Aliens , " and " The Abyss . "
and with " The Abyss , " I was putting together my love of underwater and diving , with film making .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
something interesting came out of " The Abyss , " which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
and this resulted in the first soft-surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn 't make any money , barely broke even , I should say , I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
you know , it 's Arthur Clarke 's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
they were seeing something magical .
and so that got me very excited .
and I thought , " Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . "
so , with " Terminator 2 , " which was my next film , we took that much farther .
working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film. the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did . and we created magic again .
and we had the same result with an audience .
although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience , came to , this is going to be a whole new world , this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital Domain .
and the concept of the company was that we would leap-frog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid ' 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
so , I wrote this piece called " Avatar , " which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG And the main characters would all be in CG And the world would be in CG And the envelope pushed back .
and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while .
so , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
you know , I went and pitched it to the studio as " ' Romeo and Juliet ' on a ship . "
it 's going to be this epic romance , passionate film .
secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of " Titanic . "
and that 's why I made the movie .
and that 's the truth . now , the studio didn 't know that .
but I convinced them . I said , " We 're going to dive to the wreck . we 're going to film it for real .
we 'll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . "
and I talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port , not a movie , not HD , for real .
now , that blew my mind .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself .
and I thought like , " Wow . I am like living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . "
and so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it .
it was everything . it was adventure , It was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn 't give me .
because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but I couldn 't imagine what I was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
so , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of " Titanic , " I said , " Okay , I 'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while . "
and so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the Titanic wreck .
we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn 't have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
and I 'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
when I say , I 'm operating it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I 've ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really really quite profound .
and may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing amazing animals .
they are basically aliens right here on Earth .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
they don 't survive on sunlight based system the way we do .
and so , you 're seeing animals that are living next to a 500 degree Centigrade water plumes .
you think they can 't possibly exist .
at the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well , again , it 's the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going to the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments , taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I 'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . but I also learned a lot about leadership .
now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn 't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , " What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? "
we don 't make money at these damn shows .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
people sort of think I went away between " Titanic " and " Avatar " and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
you 're doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is , for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
because we would do these things with 10-12 people working for years at a time .
sometimes at sea for 2-3 months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you 've done a task that you can 't explain to someone else .
when you come back to the shore and you say , " We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human performance aspects of working at sea , you can 't explain it to people . it 's that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when I came back to make my next movie , which was " Avatar , " I tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory doing " Avatar , " coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four and half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , people have commented on how , well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora .
to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , I think number one is curiosity .
it 's the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
I have young film makers come up to me and say , " Give me some advice for doing this . "
and I say , " Don 't put limitations on yourself .
other people will do that for you , don 't do it to yourself , don 't bet against yourself .
and take risks . "
NASA has this phrase that they like : " failure is not an option . "
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it 's a leap of faith .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that 's the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you 're doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
if I can leave you with one big idea today , it 's that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and , instead of thinking about information overload , what I 'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we 're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that I 'm using here is a little experiment .
it 's called Pivot , and with Pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths , say accidents .
and , right away , I see there 's a different pattern that emerges .
this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they 're at their most frail .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age , say 40 years or less , we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you drill into that , it 's especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here , is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced .
it 's all here . it 's all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with Pivot , you can drill into a decade .
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so I 'm looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
I 'm a Lance Armstrong fan , so I 'll go ahead and I 'll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong 's been a part of .
now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , " Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? "
so I can step back , and expand on that .
and I see Greg Lemond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way , going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out , you 're not searching , you 're not browsing .
you 're doing something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit something that 's a little bit crazy .
what we 're done here is we 've taken every single Wikipedia page and reduced it down to a little summary .
so the summary consisted of just little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
I 'm only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I 'm going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government .
some have come from natural sciences .
some , fewer still , have come from business .
there 's my boss .
and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
so you see , we 're navigating the web for the first time as if it 's actually a web , not page to page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
I 'm just showing the New York Times website here .
so Pivot , this application -- I don 't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
so I can step back , pop right back in to a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
so I can drill in to what I 've done over specific time frames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
and I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
and , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history perhaps by my search history .
here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs Pivot .
and from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it 's one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
we talk about drowning in data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then , instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
let 's pretend right here we have a machine , a big machine , a cool , TED-ish machine , and it 's a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and I wonder what you 'd choose , because I 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately , and they all want to go back .
I don 't know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or " American Idol . "
I don 't know .
I 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and I understand that .
I 'm not part of that crowd , I have to say .
I don 't want to go back , and it 's not because I 'm adventurous -- it 's because possibilities on this planet , they don 't go back , they go forward .
so I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there 's ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease .
there 's never been a time like this .
my great-grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
so there had better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it 's not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that . it 's an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it 's gone . it 's vanished .
we vanquished it . puff .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method , trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn 't , is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's all the good news because there 's some other problems , and they 've been mentioned many times , and one of them is that , despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world , every day .
that number 's rising , and it 's rising really rapidly , and it 's disgraceful .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they 're going away , and they 're going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we 're going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? I think we can .
I think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain 't wishful thinking .
but here 's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night .
we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now , never , and we 've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
we 're on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields .
and yet , I actually think we 'd have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone 's entitled to their opinion ; they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress , but you know what you 're not entitled to ?
you 're not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you 're not .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
about a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for " The New Yorker , " a little story .
and I was amazed to find opposition , opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I didn 't know what to do , so I just did what I do , I wrote a story and I moved on .
and soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn 't understand why people thought this was " Frankenfoods , " why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature 's ground .
but , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I 'm a journalist ; we type , we file , we go to dinner , it 's fine .
but these stories bothered me , and I couldn 't figure out why , and eventually I did .
and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just disturbed me so much ...
but then I thought , you know , let 's be honest : we 're at a point in this world where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambivalently .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : " progress . "
okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we shouldn 't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads .
I mean , you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right .
so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
don 't take anything for granted .
but here 's the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
and the reason I can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one I 've never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same , no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn 't matter . I doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don 't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous , disastrous because here 's a fact : the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it 's horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that .
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
because , does anyone have measles here ?
has one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles ?
doesn 't happen very much .
doesn 't happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
that 's a lot of death of measles , 20 an hour .
but since it didn 't happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah and Larry King Live .
and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation .
they don 't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no agony , polio , puff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is Paul Offit .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it 's save the lives of 400 , 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it 's good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , Paul 's a terrorist .
when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can 't testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because Paul made a vaccine .
I don 't need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases , and that 's happening We have measles in this country now .
and it 's getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it 's just a numbers game .
and they 're not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let 's have that . why not ?
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident .
no one 's ever said that before .
she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio .
no way .
fine .
why ? because we don 't have polio . and you know what ?
we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday .
today , I don 't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he 's flying to LAX , right now he 's over Ohio .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to Long Beach , and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease , and we don 't either because that 's the way the world works .
that 's the planet we live on . don 't pretend it isn 't .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn 't matter how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data says it all the time .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
it 's okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine , I 'm totally with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , I think I understand , we hate big pharma .
we hate big government . we don 't trust the man .
and we shouldn 't . our health care system sucks .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
that 's fantastic . I love big placebo .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and I have all sorts of little props here .
none of it -- ginkgo , fraud , echinacea , fraud , acai , I don 't even know what that is but we 're spending billions of dollars on it , it 's fraud .
and you know what ? when I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , " What do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . "
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
because I don 't care if it 's the secretary of H.H.S.
who 's saying , " Hmm , I 'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , " or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don 't want to be .
you end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
please , don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mindless epidemic we 're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
it 's an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
it 's ideology , it 's not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sprig of parsley , every brussel sprout has been modified by man .
you know , there weren 't tangerines in the garden of Eden .
there wasn 't any cantaloupe .
there weren 't Christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it worked and some of it didn 't .
we got rid of the stuff that didn 't .
now we can do it in a more precise way .
and there are risks , absolutely .
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
you don 't want to do that ?
I have to say , I don 't understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things I constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don 't want giant fields of the same thing , that 's wrong .
we don 't companies patenting life .
we don 't want companies owning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
Yes , you 're right . let 's fix it .
it 's true , we 've got a huge food problem , but this isn 't science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it 's law , it 's morality , it 's patent stuff .
you know science isn 't a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn 't , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we 're afraid , is really very deadening , and it 's preventing millions of people from prospering .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
disgraceful . disgraceful .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don 't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
cassava 's something that half a billion people eat .
it 's kind of like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it doesn 't have nutrients , it doesn 't have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
they wouldn 't starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn 't be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice .
and all I can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let 's ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don 't want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
this isn 't about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it 's about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don 't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that I don 't think we want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , " So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? "
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
it 's stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we 're going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we 're going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and , as far as I 'm concerned , that 's something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
one day Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an African-American man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and I 'm telling a story that many of you know , because Steve 's columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve 's book , or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental , if you 'll pardon the pun , in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of Beethoven 's first and fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton , and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement in Beethoven 's fourth symphony .
and we got talking about music . and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but , as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes .
the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding , and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
so , I just started playing .
and I played the first movement of the Beethoven violin concerto .
and as I played I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and Nathaniel 's manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity , and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin , and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete , Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius .
and we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven , and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B 's , from Bartók , all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen .
and I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles , to the charming , erudite , brilliant , Juilliard-trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for Nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions , and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us , at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us , and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for Nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we 're at Walt Disney Concert Hall , or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
thank you .
thank you . thanks .
Robert Gupta .
I want to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists .
so , please forgive me .
several years ago , here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea 's pretty simple .
teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it 's actually pretty hard , because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so I thought that this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , I 've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there 's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I 'd like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jockey for power , then they spend some time planning , organizing .
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures and then , finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and Ta-da !
they admire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the " ta-da " turns into an " uh-oh , " because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more " uh-oh " moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
they lie , they cheat , they get distracted , and they produce really lame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more " ta-da " structures , and , among the best , are recent graduates of kindergarten .
and it 's pretty amazing .
as Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they 're the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and Peter likes to say that , " None of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti Inc . " right .
they don 't spend time jockeying for power .
but there 's another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right .
and then they execute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time , and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kindergarteners do differently , is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix ill built prototypes along the way .
so designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn 't work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let 's look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches , business schools students , about half of that , lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
39 inches is the tallest structure I 've seen .
and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self-re-enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so CEOs , a little bit better than average .
but here 's where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
it 's incredible . you know , you look around , you go , " Oh , that team 's going to win . "
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of facilitation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who manages and pays a close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and I tried something interesting .
I thought , let 's up the ante once .
so I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here 's what happened .
not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they could have taken home the prize .
so , isn 't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
so there 's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
and the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn 't it .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , may want to go to marshmallowchallenge.com.
it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
there 's step-by-step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
there 's world records on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and , sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an " uh-oh " moment to a " ta-da " moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
I 'm a savant , or more precisely , a high-functioning autistic savant .
it 's a rare condition .
and rarer still when accompanied , as in my case , by self-awareness and a mastery of language .
very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me there 's a certain kind of awkwardness .
I can see it in their eyes .
they want to ask me something .
and in the end , quite often , the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out : " if I give you my date of birth , can you tell me what day of the week I was born on ? "
or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or long text .
I hope you 'll forgive me if I don 't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today .
I 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots -- a little deeper and a lot closer , to my mind , than work .
I want to talk to you briefly about perception .
when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name , Anton Chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him -- little details that other people seem to miss .
every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life , I 'm reminded of why I too became a writer .
in my books , I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding .
here are three questions drawn from my work .
rather than try to figure them out , I 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them .
for example , the calculation .
can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall ?
or look at the foreign word and the sounds .
can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it 's pointing you towards ?
and in terms of the line of poetry , why does the poet use the word hare rather than rabbit ?
I 'm asking you to do this because I believe our personal perceptions , you see , are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge .
aesthetic judgments , rather than abstract reasoning , guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know .
I 'm an extreme example of this .
my worlds of words and numbers blur with color , emotion and personality .
as Juan said , it 's the condition that scientists call synesthesia , an unusual cross-talk between the senses .
here are the numbers one to 12 as I see them -- every number with its own shape and character .
one is a flash of white light .
six is a tiny and very sad black hole .
the sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
three is green .
four is blue .
five is yellow .
I paint as well .
and here is one of my paintings .
it 's a multiplication of two prime numbers .
three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape , the answer to the sum .
what about bigger numbers ?
well you can 't get much bigger than Pi , the mathematical constant .
it 's an infinite number -- literally goes on forever .
in this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of Pi , I take the colors and the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape .
but it 's not only numbers that I see in colors .
words too , for me , have colors and emotions and textures .
and this is an opening phrase from the novel " Lolita . "
and Nabokov was himself synesthetic .
and you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out .
another example : a little bit more mathematical .
and I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from " The Great Gatsby . "
there is a procession of syllables -- wheat , one ; prairies , two ; lost Swede towns , three -- one , two , three .
and this effect is very pleasant on the mind , and it helps the sentence to feel right .
let 's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago .
64 multiplied by 75 .
if some of you play chess , you 'll know that 64 is a square number , and that 's why chessboards , eight by eight , have 64 squares .
so that gives us a form that we can picture , that we can perceive .
what about 75 ?
well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this .
so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind -- something like this .
64 becomes 6,400 .
and in the right-hand corner , you don 't have to calculate anything .
four across , four up and down -- it 's 16 .
so what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 , 16 , 16 .
that 's a lot easier than the school taught you to do math , I 'm sure .
it 's 16 , 16 , 16 , 48 , 4,800 -- 4,000 , the answer to the sum .
easy when you know how .
the second question was an Icelandic word .
I 'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic .
so let me narrow the choices down to two .
is it a happy word , or a sad word ?
what do you say ?
okay .
some people say it 's happy .
most people , a majority of people , say sad .
and it actually means sad .
why do , statistically , a majority of people say that a word is sad , in this case , heavy in other cases ?
in my theory , language evolves in such a way that sounds match , correspond with the subjective , with the personal intuitive experience of the listener .
let 's have a look at the third question .
it 's a line from a poem by John Keats .
words , like numbers , express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world .
it stands to reason that we , existing in this world , should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships .
and poets , like other artists , play with those intuitive understandings .
in the case of hare , it 's an ambiguous sound in English .
it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head .
and if we think of that -- let me put the picture up -- the fibers represent vulnerability .
they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension .
the hare itself , the animal -- not a cat , not a dog , a hare -- why a hare ?
because think of the picture , not the word , the picture .
the overlong ears , the overlarge feet , helps us to picture , to feel intuitively , what it means to limp and to tremble .
so in these few minutes , I hope I 've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things , and to show you that words can have colors and emotions , numbers , shapes and personalities .
the world is richer , vaster than it too often seems to be .
I hope that I 've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes .
thank you .
I 'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum .
I grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural Arkansas , an hour from the nearest movie theater .
and I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist , because I grew up around quirky , colorful characters who were great at making with their hands .
and my childhood is more hick than I could ever possibly relate to you , and also more intellectual than you would ever expect .
for instance , me and my sister , when we were little , we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains .
but on the other side of that though , we were big readers in our house .
and if the TV was on , we were watching a documentary .
and my dad is the most voracious reader I know .
he can read a novel or two a day .
but when I was little , I remember , he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun .
and what was so amazing to me about that -- well he would be in his recliner , would holler for me to fetch the BB gun , and I 'd go get it .
and what was amazing to me -- well it was pretty kickass ; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun -- but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it .
and he could shoot it from two rooms away and not damage what it was on , because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it landed on .
so I should talk about art .
or we 'll be here all day with my childhood stories .
I love contemporary art , but I 'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene .
a few years ago , I spent months in Europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
and I was struck by going to so many , one after the other , with some clarity of what it was that I was longing for .
and I was longing for several things that I wasn 't getting , or not getting enough of .
but two of the main things : one of it , I was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible .
and the second thing that I was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique .
so I started thinking and listing what all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial .
so I decided , I 'm going to start my own biennial .
I 'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world .
so I thought , okay , I have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
so amongst all the criteria I have , there 's two main things .
one of them , I call my Mimaw 's Test .
and what that is is I imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes .
and if I can explain it in five minutes , then it 's too obtuse or esoteric and it hasn 't been refined enough yet .
it needs to worked on until it can speak fluently .
and then my other second set of rules -- I hate to say " rules " because it 's art -- my criteria would be the three H 's , which is head , heart and hands .
and great art would have head : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts .
it would have heart in that it would have passion and heart and soul .
and it would have hand in that it would be greatly crafted .
so I started thinking about how am I going to do this biennial , how am I going to travel the world and find these artists .
and then I realized one day , there 's an easier solution to this .
I 'm just going to make the whole thing myself .
and so this is what I did .
so I thought , a biennial needs artists .
I 'm going to do an international biennial , I need artists from all around the world .
so what I did was I invented a hundred artists from around the world .
I figured out their bios , their their passions in life and their art styles , and I started making their work .
I felt , oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing .
so I decided , I 'm going to make this a real biennial .
it 's going to be two years of studio work .
and I 'm going to create this in two years .
and I have .
so I should start to talk about these guys .
well the range is quite a bit .
and I 'm such a technician , so I loved project , getting to play with all the techniques .
so for example , in realist paintings , it ranges from this , which is kind of old masters style , to really realistic still-life , to this type of painting where I 'm painting with a single hair .
and then at the other end , there 's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one , and outdoor installations like this one and this one .
I know I should mention , I 'm making all these things .
this isn 't Photoshopped .
I 'm under the river with those fish .
so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you .
this is Nell Remmel .
Nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
this piece , which is called " Flipped Earth " -- she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground .
and by taking giant mirrors -- And here she 's taking giant mirrors and pulling them into the dirt .
and this is 22 ft. long .
and what I loved about her work is , when I would walk around it and look down into the sky , looking down to watch the sky , and it unfolded in a new way .
and probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground 's dark , but there 's still the light above , bright above .
and so you 're standing there and everything else is dark , but there 's this portal that you want to jump in .
this piece was great . this is in my parents ' backyard in Arkansas .
and I love to dig a hole .
so this piece was great fun , because it was two days of digging in soft dirt .
the next artist is Kay Overstry , and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience .
and in her most recent project , it 's called " Weather I Made . "
and she 's making weather on her body 's scale .
and this piece is " Frost . "
and what she did was she went out on a cold , dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave -- to leave her life 's mark , the mark of her life .
and so this is five foot , five inches of frost that she left behind .
the sun rises , and it melts away .
and that was played by my mom .
so the next artist , this is a group of Japanese artists , a collective of Japanese artists -- in Tokyo .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space .
and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
one of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
and so what they 're doing -- each of these artists on a nine by seven-inch card , which they sell for 10 bucks , they drew original works of art .
and you buy one , and maybe you get a real piece , and maybe not .
well this has sparked a craze in Japan , because everyone 's wanting a masterpiece .
and the ones that are the most sought after are the ones that are only barely scratched off .
and all these works , in some way , talk about luck or fate or chance .
those first two are portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win .
and in this one it 's called " Drawing the Short Stick . "
I love these piece because I have a little cousin at home who introduced me -- which I think is such a great introduction -- to a friend one day as , " This is my cousin Shea .
he draws sticks real good . "
which is one of the best compliments ever .
this artist is Gus Weinmueller , and he 's doing a project , a large project , called " Art for the Peoples . "
and within this project , he 's doing a smaller project called " Artists in Residence . "
and what he does is -- he spends a week at a time with a family .
and he shows up on their porch , their doorstep , with a toothbrush and pajamas , and he 's ready to spend the week with them .
and using only what 's present , he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of .
and he spends that week talking to the family about what do they think great art is .
he has all these discussions with their family .
and he digs through everything they have , and he finds materials to make work .
and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is .
for this family , he made this still-life painting .
and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property .
this next project , this is by Jaochim Parisvega , and he 's interested in -- He believes art is everywhere waiting -- that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen .
and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces , like in his series where he used rain to make paintings .
this project is called " Love Nests . "
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
so he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them , and they crafted his nests for him .
and this one 's called " Lovelock 's Nest . "
this one 's called " Mixtape Love Song 's Nest . "
and this one 's called " Lovemaking Nest . "
next is Sylvia Slater .
Sylvia 's interested in art training .
she 's a very serious Swiss artist .
and she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries , and she was thinking , what can I make that would be of value to them , in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman .
and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them .
and you would carry this around with you , and if everything went to hell , you could make payments and buy your life .
so this life price is for an irrigation non-profit director .
so hopefully what happens is you never use it , and it 's an heirloom that you pass down .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
and so they 're valuable . this is precious metals and gemstones .
and this one had to get broken up .
he had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently .
this is by a duo , Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland .
and they 're interested in creating culture , just tradition .
so what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area .
so this is in Eastern Tennessee , and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death .
so they came up with dig jigs .
and a dig jig -- a dig jig is where , for a milestone anniversary or a birthday , you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you 're going to be buried .
and we got a lot of attention when we did it .
I talked my family into doing this , and they didn 't know what I was doing .
and I was like , " Get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . "
and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
so what happens is you dance on the grave .
and after you 've done your dance , everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are .
and you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for .
that 's my mom and dad .
this is by Jason Birdsong .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
you know , we look down a dark alley or a jungle path , trying to make out a face or a creature .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
and he plays with this idea .
and this piece : those aren 't actually leaves .
they 're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage .
so he pairs these up .
there 's another pile of leaves .
those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
like this is a painting of a snake in a box .
so you open the box and you think , " Who , there 's a snake in there . "
but it 's actually a painting .
so he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage .
the next artist is Hazel Clausen .
Hazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided , " You know , I would learn a lot about culture if I created a culture that doesn 't exist from scratch . "
so that 's what she did .
she created the Swiss people named the Uvulites , and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for .
and also they reference how the uvula -- Everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
and that 's the symbol of their culture .
and this is from a documentary called " Sexual Practices and Populations Control Among the Uvulites . "
this is a typical angora embroidery for them .
this is one of their founders , Gert Schaeffer .
and actually this is my Aunt Irene .
it was so funny having a fake person who was making fake things .
and I crack up at this piece , because when I see it I know that 's French angora and all antique German ribbons and wool that I got in a Nebraska mill and carried around for 10 years and then antique Chinese skirts .
the next is a collective of artists called the Silver Dobermans .
and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time .
and they 're really interested in how over-coddled we 've become .
so this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we 've become .
and what they 've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence .
and this is called " Horse Sense Fence . "
the next artist is K. M. Yoon , a really interesting South Korean artist .
and he 's reworking a Confucian art tradition of scholar stones .
next is Maynard Sipes .
and I love Maynard Sipes , but he 's off in his own world , and , bless his heart , he 's so paranoid .
next is Roy Penig , a really interesting Kentucky artist , and he 's the nicest guy .
he even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese because the person wanted it so badly .
next is an Australian artist , Janeen Jackson , and this is from a project of hers called " What an Artwork Does When We 're Not Watching . "
next is by a Lithuanian fortune teller , Jurgi Petrauskas .
next is Ginger Cheshire .
this is from a short film of hers called " The Last Person . "
and that 's my cousin and my sister 's dog , Gabby .
the next , this is by Sam Sandy .
he 's an Australian Aboriginal elder , and he 's also an artist .
and this is from a large traveling sculpture project that he 's doing .
this is from Estelle Willoughsby .
she heals with color .
and she 's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though she 's going to be 90 next year .
this is by Z. Zhou , and he 's interested in stasis .
next is by Hilda Singh , and she 's doing a whole project called " Social Outfit . "
next is by Vera Sokolova .
and I have to say , Vera kind of scares me .
you can 't look her directly in the eyes , because she 's kind of scary .
and it 's good that she 's not real ; she 'd be mad that I said that .
and she 's an optometrist in St. Petersburg , and she plays with optics .
next , this is by Thomas Swifton .
this is from a short film , " Adventures of Skinny . "
and this is by Cicily Bennett , and it 's from a series of short films .
and after this one , there 's 77 other artists .
and all together with those other 77 you 're not seeing , that 's my biennial .
thank you .
my name is Joshua Walters .
I 'm a performer .
but as far as being a performer , I 'm also diagnosed bipolar .
I reframe that as a positive , because the crazier I get onstage , the more entertaining I become .
when I was 16 in San Francisco , I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ .
maybe you thought that was scary , but actually there 's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you 're Jesus Christ .
I was sent to a place , a psych ward , and in the psych ward , everyone is doing their own one-man show .
there 's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
they 're just practicing .
one day they 'll get here .
now when I got out , I was diagnosed and I was given medications by a psychiatrist .
" okay , Josh , why don 't we give you some -- why don 't we give you some Zyprexa .
okay ? Mmhmm ?
at least that 's what it says on my pen . "
some of you are in the field , I can see .
I can feel your noise .
the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode , and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs , where I was sleeping through high school .
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
when I got out I had a choice .
I could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental skillness .
there 's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive -- at least the hypomanic edge part of it .
now if you don 't know what hypomania is , it 's like an engine that 's out of control , maybe a Ferrari engine , with no breaks .
many of the speakers here , many of you in the audience , have that creative edge , if you know what I 'm talking about .
you 're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
and there 's a book -- John Gartner .
John Gartner wrote this book called " The hypomanic Edge " in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete .
a different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called " Touched With Fire " by Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with .
some of them committed suicide .
so it wasn 't all the good side of the illness .
now recently , there 's been development in this field .
and there was an article written in the New York Times , September 2010 , that stated : " just Manic Enough . "
just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum -- you know what I 'm talking about -- not maybe full bipolar , but they 're in the bipolar spectrum -- where on one side , maybe you think you 're Jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
your call . your call .
and everyone 's somewhere in the middle .
everyone 's somewhere in the middle .
so maybe , you know , there 's no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn 't mean you 're crazy .
but maybe it just means you 're more sensitive to what most people can 't see or feel .
maybe no one 's really crazy .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum .
how much depends on how lucky you are .
thank you .
it 's an amazing thing that we 're here to talk about the year of patients rising .
you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , " You know what , I know what the odds are , but I 'm going to go look for more information .
I 'm going to define what the terms of my success are . "
I 'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died -- found out I was , in fact , already almost dead .
and what I then found out about what 's called the e-patient movement -- I 'll explain what that term means .
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave , and when I discovered this , I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave .
regarding the word " patient , " when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who 's not in the room here , somebody out there .
some of our talks today , we still act like that .
but I 'm here to tell you , " patient " is not a third-person word .
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads nodding , people who say , " Yes , I know exactly what you mean . "
so when you hear what I 'm going to talk about here today , first of all , I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met , all the ones I haven 't met .
this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care , in fixing health care .
one of the senior doctors at my hospital , Charlie Safran , and his colleague , Warner Slack , have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient .
they have been saying that since the 1970s .
now I 'm going to step back in history .
this is from July , 1969 .
I was a freshman in college , and this was when we first landed on the Moon .
and it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface -- that 's the place where you and I are right now , where we live .
the world was changing .
it was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee .
a few weeks later , Woodstock happened .
three days of fun and music .
here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year .
Yeah , the wavy hair , the blue eyes -- it was really something .
that Fall of 1969 , the Whole Earth Catalog came out .
it was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency .
we think of hippies of being just hedonists , but there 's a very strong component -- I was in that movement -- a very strong component of being responsible for yourself .
this book 's title 's subtitle is : " access to Tools . "
and it talked about how to build your own house , how to grow your own food , all kinds of things .
in the 1980s , this doctor , Tom Ferguson , was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog .
and he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves .
in fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies .
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information .
and when the Web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
and he coined this term e-Patients -- equipped , engaged , empowered , enabled .
obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then .
now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term .
in 2006 , I went to my doctor for a regular physical , and I had said , " I have a sore shoulder . "
well , I got an X-ray , and the next morning -- you may have noticed , those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this .
this morning , some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition .
for me , it was 9 : 00 AM on January 3 , 2007 .
I was at the office ; my desk was clean ; I had the blue partition carpet on the walls .
the phone rang and it was my doctor .
he said , " Dave , I pulled up the X-ray image on the screen on the computer at home . "
he said , " Your shoulder 's going to be fine , but Dave , there 's something in your lung . "
and if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there .
to make a long story short , I said , " So you need me to get back in there ? "
he said , " Yeah , we 're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest . "
and in parting I said , " Is there anything I should do ? "
he said -- think about this one .
this is the advice your doctor gives you .
" just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife . "
I went in for the CAT scan , and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs .
so at that point we knew that it was cancer .
we knew it wasn 't lung cancer .
that meant it was metastasized from somewhere .
the question was , where from ?
so I went in for an ultrasound .
I got to do what many women have -- the jelly on the belly and bzzzz .
my wife came with me .
she 's a veterinarian , so she 's seen lots of ultrasounds .
I mean , she knows I 'm not a dog .
but what we saw -- this is an MRI image .
this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be .
what we saw in that kidney was that big blob there .
and there were actually two of these .
one was growing out the front and it had already erupted , and it latched onto the bowel .
one was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that I 'd never heard of , but all of a sudden I cared about it .
I went home .
now I 've been Googling -- I 've been online since 1989 on Compuserv .
I went home , and I know you can 't read the details here ; that 's not important .
my point is I went to a respected medical website , WebMD , because I know how to filter out junk .
I also found my wife online .
before I met her , I went through some suboptimal search results .
so I looked for quality information .
there 's so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ?
where does my body end and an invader start ?
and cancer , a tumor , is something you grow out of your own tissue .
how does that happen ?
where does medical ability end and start ?
well , so what I read on WebMD : " the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer .
almost all patients are incurable . "
I 've been online long enough to know if I don 't like the first results I get , I go look for more .
and what I found was on other websites , even by the third page of Google results , " Outlook is bleak " , " Prognosis is grim . "
and I 'm thinking , " What the heck ? "
I didn 't feel sick at all .
I mean , I 'd been getting tired in the evening , but I was 56 years-old .
I was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do .
it was really something .
and this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got .
totally by coincidence , there 's that thing in my lung .
in the left femur , the left thigh bone , there 's another one .
I had one . my leg eventually snapped .
I fainted and landed on it , and it broke .
there 's one in the skull , and then just for good measure , I had these other tumors -- including , by the time my treatment started , one was growing out of my tongue .
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue .
and what I read was that my median survival was 24 weeks .
this was bad .
I was facing the grave .
I thought , " What 's my mother 's face going to look like on the day of my funeral ? "
I had to sit down with my daughter and say , " Here 's the situation . "
her boyfriend was with her .
I said , " I don 't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while dad 's still alive . "
it 's really serious .
because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
well , my doctor prescribed a patient community , ACOR.ORG , a network of cancer patients , of all amazing things .
very quickly they told me , " Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease .
get yourself to a specialist center .
there is no cure , but there 's something that sometimes works -- it usually doesn 't -- called high-dosage interleukin .
most hospitals don 't offer it , so they won 't even tell you it exists .
and don 't let them give you anything else first .
and by the way , here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers .
how amazing is that ?
here 's the thing .
here we are , four years later , you can 't find a website that gives patients that information .
Government approved , American Cancer Society , but patients know what patients want to know .
it 's the power of patient networks .
this amazing substance -- again I mentioned , where does my body end ?
my oncologist and I talk a lot these days , because I try to keep my talks technically accurate .
and he said , " You know , the immune system is good at detecting invaders -- bacteria coming from outside -- but when it 's your own tissue that you 've grown , it 's a whole different thing . "
and I went through a mental exercise actually , because I started a patient support community of my own on a website , and one of my friends , one of my relatives actually , said , " Look , Dave , who grew this thing ?
are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself ? "
so we went into it .
and the story of how all that happens is in this book .
anyway , this is the way the numbers unfolded .
me being me , I put the numbers from my hospital 's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet .
don 't worry about the numbers .
you see , that 's the immune system .
amazing thing , those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart .
and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between .
just incredible .
who knows what we 'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it .
the punch line is that a year and a half later , I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married .
and when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she didn 't have to say to her mother , " I wish Dad could have been here . "
and this is what we 're doing when we make health care better .
now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
this is Regina Holliday , a painter in Washington D.C. , whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease .
she 's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital .
one of the things that she discovered was that her husband 's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized .
and she thought , " You know , if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box , why can 't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty , every new doctor , the basics about my husband 's condition ? "
so she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label , something like that , in a diagram of him .
she then , last year , painted this diagram .
she studied health care like me .
she came to realize that there were a lot of people who 'd written patient advocate books that you just don 't hear about at medical conferences .
patients are such an underutilized resource .
well as it says in my introduction , I 've got somewhat know for saying that patients should have access to their data .
and I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago , " Give me my damn data , because you people can 't be trusted to keep it clean . "
and hear she has our dammed data -- it 's a pun -- which is starting to break out , starting to break through -- the water symbolizes our data .
and in fact , I want to do a little something improvisational for you here .
there 's a guy on Twitter that I know , a health IT guy outside Boston , and he wrote the e-Patient rap .
and it goes like this .
♫ Gimme my damn data ♫ ♫ I want to be an e-Patient just like Dave ♫ ♫ Gimme my damn data , cuz it 's my life to save ♫ Now I 'm not going to go any further .
well thank you . that shot the timing .
think about the possibility , why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family ?
here 's a website , VisibleBody.com , that I stumbled across .
and I thought , " You know , I wonder what my soleus muscle is ? "
so you can click on things and remove it .
and I saw , " Aha , that 's the kidney and the soleus muscle . "
and I was rotating it in 3D and saying , " I understand now . "
and then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth , where you can fly to any address .
and I thought , " Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body ? "
what did Google come out with this year ?
now there 's Google Body browser .
but you see , it 's still generic .
it 's not my data .
but if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it , the way software innovators like to do , who knows what we 'll be able to come up with .
one final story : this is Kelly Young , a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida .
this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks .
RA patients , as they call themselves -- her blog is RA Warrior -- have a big problem because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms .
and that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going .
and some doctors think , " Yeah right , you 're really in pain . "
well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that 's usually used for cancer , but it can also reveal inflammation .
and she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray .
so she took it .
and the radiologist report said , " No cancer found . "
well that 's not what he was supposed to do with it .
so she had it read again , she wanted to have it read again , and her doctor fired her .
she pulled up the CD .
he said , " If you don 't want to follow my instructions , go away . "
so she pulled up the CD of the scan images , and look at all those hot spots .
and she 's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care .
see , that is an empowered patient -- no medical training .
we are , you are , the most underused resource in health care .
what she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data .
how big a deal was this ?
well at TED2009 , Tim Berners-Lee himself , inventor of the Web , gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people 's articles about the data , but the raw data .
and he got them chanting by the end of the talk , " Raw data now .
raw data now . "
and I ask you , three words , please , to improve health care : let patients help .
let patients help .
let patients help .
let patients help .
thank you .
for all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast , God bless you , everyone -- let patients help .
and bless yourself . thank you very much .
by birth and by choice , I 've been involved with the auto industry my entire life , and for the past 30 years , I 've worked at Ford Motor Company .
and for most of those years , I 've worried about , how am I going to sell more cars and trucks ?
but today I worry about , what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks ?
what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles , triples , or even quadruples ?
my life is guided by two great passions , and the first is automobiles .
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company .
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway .
and I decided about that time , about age 10 , that it would be really cool if I was a test driver .
so my parents would go to dinner .
they 'd sit down , I 'd sneak out of the house .
I 'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway , and it was a blast .
and that went on for about two years , until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III .
and it was snowing that day .
so he and mom went to dinner .
and I snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure-eights in the snow .
my dad finished dinner early that evening .
and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall .
so it kind of cooled my test driving for a little while .
but I really began to love cars then .
and my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang .
and even though the color was pretty hideous , I did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that 's continued on to this day .
but cars are really more than a passion of mine ; they quite literally in my blood .
my great grandfather was Henry Ford , and on my mother 's side , my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone .
so when I was born , I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me .
but my great grandfather , Henry Ford , really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
because he believed that , with mobility , comes freedom and progress .
and that 's a belief that I share .
my other great passion is the environment .
and as a young boy , I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about .
and it really struck me as the years went by , in a very negative way , when I would go to some stream that I 'd loved , and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies , and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it .
and so even at a young age , that really resonated with me .
and the whole notion of environmental preservation , at a very basic level , sunk in with me .
as a high-schooler , I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey .
and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world .
but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature .
and that was true until I got to college .
and when I got to college , you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country .
they thought that we were more interested , as an industry , in profits , rather than progress , and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly , we were the enemy .
I joined Ford after college , after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do .
but I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there .
and as I look back over 30 years ago , it was a little naive to think at that age that I could , but I wanted to .
and I really discovered that my professors weren 't completely wrong .
in fact , when I got back to Detroit , my environmental leanings weren 't exactly embraced by those in my own company , and certainly by those in the industry .
I had some very interesting conversations , as you can imagine .
there were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with " environmental wackos " .
I was considered a radical .
and I 'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists .
of course , I had no intention of doing that .
and I kept speaking out about the environment .
and it really was the topic that we now today sustainability .
and in time , my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today .
I mean , I think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it .
and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford , but really as an industry .
we 're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights .
and with new technology , we 're reducing -- and I believe , someday will eliminate -- CO2 emissions .
we 're starting to sell electric cars , which is great .
we 're developing alternative power trains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically , socially and environmentally .
and actually , although we 've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do , I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony .
but unfortunately , as we 're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said , we 're not there yet ; we 've got a lot of work to do , but I can see where we will -- but even as we 're in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people aren 't noticing .
and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened , just as the environment is .
the problem , put in its simplest terms , is one of mathematics .
today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world .
and within our lifetime , that number 's going to grow to about nine billion .
and at that population level , our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth .
and with that growth comes some severe practical problems , one of which is our transportation system simply won 't be able to deal with it .
when we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clearer .
today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
but with more people and greater prosperity around the world , that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century .
and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before .
now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives .
today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams .
and that 's a huge waste of time and resources .
but that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest .
today the average driver in Beijing has a five-hour commute .
and last summer -- many of you probably saw this -- there was a hundred-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China .
in the decades to come , 75 percent of the world 's population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more .
so you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing .
when you factor in population growth , it 's clear that mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow .
frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars .
and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam .
so , if we make no changes today , what does tomorrow look like ?
well I think you probably already have the picture .
traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge , and they 're really very , very inconvenient , but that 's all they are .
but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers .
and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised .
so what 's going to solve this ?
well the answer isn 't going to be more of the same .
my great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T , " If I had asked people then what they wanted , they would have answered , ' We want faster horses . ' " so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads .
when America began moving West , we didn 't add more wagon trains , we built railroads .
and to connect our country after World War II , we didn 't build more two-lane highways , we built the interstate highway system .
today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future .
we are going to build smart cars , but we also need to build smart roads , smart parking , smart public transportation systems and more .
we don 't want to waste our time sitting in traffic , sitting at toll booths or looking for parking spots .
we need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers .
and frankly , that 's the kind of system that 's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable .
now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world .
the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another , and they go underneath the city streets .
and up above , you 've got a series of pedestrian walkways .
on New York City 's 34th St. , gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle-specific corridors .
pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created , and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes .
now if you look at Hong Kong , they have a very interesting system called Octopus there .
it 's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system .
so parking garages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system .
now shared car services are also springing up around the world .
and these efforts , I think , are great .
they 're relieving congestion , and they 're frankly starting to save some fuel .
these are all really good ideas that will move us forward .
but what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other .
very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network .
every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn , Michigan .
and every night I go home , my commute is a total crap shoot .
and I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home .
but very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other .
so if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic , it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way .
and these systems are being tested right now , and frankly they 're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon .
but the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless .
one day very soon , you 're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system .
so you get in your car , and as you get in your car , your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive -- no more driving around looking for one , which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today 's cars in urban areas is looking for parking spots .
or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you don 't have to wait in the cold to hail one .
or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave , so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time .
this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system .
so I think it 's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem .
but as we found out with addressing CO2 issues , and also fossil fuels , there is no one silver bullet .
the solution is not going to be more cars , more roads or a new rail system ; it can only be found , I believe , in a global network of interconnected solutions .
now I know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work , but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven 't even thought of yet , our overall transportation mix and infrastructure must support all the future options .
we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue .
companies , entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity , as well as an enormous social problem .
and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge -- and it 's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power , how much money and how much serious thought has , really over the last three years , just poured into the green energy field .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock .
but we need people like all of you in this room , leading thinkers .
I mean , frankly I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue .
and we need people from all walks of life ; not just inventors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge .
this isn 't going to be solved by any one person or one group .
it 's going to really require a national energy policy , frankly for each country , because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels , traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are .
but we need to get going , and we need to get going today .
and we must have an infrastructure that 's designed to support this flexible future .
you know , we 've come a long way .
since the Model T , most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire life time .
and since then , the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live , where we work , where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around .
we don 't want to regress and lose that freedom .
we 're on our way to solving -- and as I said earlier , I know we 've got a long way to go -- the one big issue that we 're all focused on that threatens it , and that 's the environmental issue , but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock .
because in doing so , we 're going to preserve what we 've really come to take for granted , which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world .
and it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this .
because , if you can envision , as I do , a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today , that 's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow .
I believe we 're at our best when we 're confronted with big issues .
this is a big one , and it won 't wait .
so let 's get started now .
thank you .
the Highline is an old , elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan .
and it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave .
and it became known as " Death Avenue " because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front , and he became known as the " West Side Cowboy . "
but even with a cowboy , about one person a month was killed and run over .
so they elevated it .
they built it 30 ft. in the air , right through the middle of the city .
but with the rise of interstate trucking , it was used less and less .
and by 1980 , the last train rode .
it was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say , at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district .
and then it was abandoned .
and I live in the neighborhood , and I first read about it in the New York Times , in an article that said it was going to be demolished .
and I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer , but I realized no one was doing anything .
I went to my first community board meeting -- which I 'd never been to one before -- and sat next to another guy named Joshua David , who 's a travel writer .
and at the end of the meeting , we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project ; most people wanted to tear it down .
so we exchanged business cards , and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization , Friends of the High Line .
and the goal at first was just saving it from demolition , but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it .
and what first attracted me , or interested me , was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure , sort of rusty , this industrial relic .
but when I went up on top , it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River .
and that 's really where we started , the idea coalesced around , let 's make this a park , and let 's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape .
at the time , there was a lot of opposition .
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down .
I 'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement .
Mayor Bloomberg came in office , he was very supportive , but we still had to make the economic case .
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case .
and it turns out , we got those numbers wrong .
we thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build .
so far it 's cost about 150 million .
and the main case was , this is going to make good economic sense for the city .
so we said over a 20-year time period , the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million .
that was enough . it really got the city behind it .
it turns out we were wrong on that .
now people estimate it 's created about a half a billion dollars , or will create about a half a billion dollars , in tax revenues for the city .
we did a design competition , selected a design team .
we worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape .
there 's three sections .
we opened the fist section in 2009 .
it 's been successful beyond our dreams .
last year we had about two million people , which is about 10 times what we ever estimated .
this is one of my favorite features in section one .
it 's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave .
and the first section ends at 20th St. right now .
the other thing , it 's generated , obviously , a lot of economic value ; it 's also inspired , I think , a lot of great architecture .
there 's a point , you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry , Jean Nouvel , Shigeru Ban , Neil Denari .
and the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line .
and this has been designed by Renzo Piano .
and they 're going to break ground in May .
and we 've already started construction on section two .
this is one of my favorite features , this flyover where you 're eight feet off the surface of the High Line , running through a canopy of trees .
the High Line used to be covered in billboards , and so we 've taken a playful take where , instead of framing advertisements , it 's going to frame people in views of the city .
this was just installed last month .
and then the last section was going to go around the rail yards , which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan .
and the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around .
but what really , I think , makes the High Line special is the people .
and honestly , even though I love the designs that we were building , I was always frightened that I wouldn 't really love it , because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic ?
but what I found is it 's in the people and how they use it that , to me , makes it so special .
just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line .
and I realized New Yorkers don 't hold hands ; we just don 't do that outside .
but you see that happening on the High Line , and I think that 's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other .
thanks .
a few years ago , I felt like I was stuck in a rut , so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher , Morgan Spurlock , and try something new for 30 days .
the idea is actually pretty simple .
think about something you 've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
it turns out , 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life .
there 's a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
the first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
this was part of a challenge I did to take a picture everyday for a month .
and I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges , my self-confidence grew .
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work -- for fun .
even last year , I ended up hiking up Mt . Kilimanjaro , the highest mountain in Africa .
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough , you can do anything for 30 days .
have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
every November , tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000 word novel from scratch in 30 days .
it turns out , all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month .
so I did .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you 've written your words for the day .
you might be sleep-deprived , but you 'll finish your novel .
now is my book the next great American novel ?
no . I wrote it in a month .
it 's awful .
but for the rest of my life , if I meet john Hodgman at a TED party , I don 't have to say , " I 'm a computer scientist . "
no , no , if I want to I can say , " I 'm a novelist . "
so here 's one last thing I 'd like to mention .
I learned that when I made small , sustainable changes , things I could keep doing , they were more likely to stick .
there 's nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
in fact , they 're a ton of fun .
but they 're less likely to stick .
when I gave up sugar for 30 days , day 31 looked like this .
so here 's my question to you : what are you waiting for ?
I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not , so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days .
thanks .
good morning everybody .
I work with really amazing little itty bitty creatures called cells .
and let me tell you what it 's like to grow these cells in the lab .
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment .
we plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
and we feed them -- sterilly of course -- with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food -- and we grow them in incubators .
why do I do this ?
we observe the cells in a plate , and they 're just on the surface .
but what we 're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of them .
what does that even mean ?
well it means growing an actual heart , let 's say , or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body .
not only that , but they can also be used for disease models .
and for this purpose , traditional cell culture techniques just really aren 't enough .
the cells are kind of homesick ; the dish doesn 't feel like their home .
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive .
we call this the biomimetic paradigm -- copying nature in the lab .
let 's take the example of the heart , the topic of a lot of my research .
what makes the heart unique ?
well , the heart beats , rhythmically , tirelessly , faithfully .
we copy this in the lab by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes .
these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells to contract in the lab .
what else do we know about the heart ?
well heart cells are pretty greedy .
nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very , very dense blood supply .
in the lab , we micro-pattern channels in the biomaterials on which we grow the cells .
and this allows us to flow the cell culture media , the cells ' food , through the scaffolds where we 're growing the cells -- a lot like what you might expect from a capillary bed in the heart .
so this brings me to lesson number one : life can do a lot with very little .
let 's take the example of electrical stimulation .
let 's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be .
on the left , we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that I engineered from rat cells in the lab .
it 's about the size of a mini marshmallow .
and after one week , it 's beating .
you can see it in the upper left-hand corner .
but don 't worry if you can 't see it so well .
it 's amazing that these cells beat at all .
but what 's really amazing is that the cells , when we electrically stimulate them like with a pacemaker , that they beat so much more .
but that brings me to lesson number two : cells do all the work .
in a sense , tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here , because structural engineers build bridges and big things , computer engineers , computers , but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves .
what does this mean for us ?
let 's do something really simple .
let 's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept .
let 's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way .
" we are what we eat , " could easily be described as , " We are what our cells eat . "
and in the case of the flora in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
but it 's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life .
behind every sound , sight , touch , taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us .
it begs the question : shall we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies ?
I invite you to talk about this with me further , and in the meantime , I wish you luck .
may none of your non-cancer cells become endangered species .
thank you .
you know , cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy .
for students , it 's quite an experience , but for a school , it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain .
so we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught , they do not have a cadaver dissection lab .
maybe those reasons , or depending on where you are , cadavers may not be easily available .
so to address this , we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford : virtual dissection table .
so we call this Anatomage Table .
so with this Anatomage Table , students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver .
and the table form is important , and since it 's touch-interactive , just like the way they do dissections in the lab , or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table .
our digital body is one-to-one life size , so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy .
I 'm going to do some demonstrations .
as you can see , I use my finger to interact with my digital body .
I 'm going to do some cuts .
I can cut any way I want to , so I cut right here .
then it 's going to show inside .
and I can change my cut to see different parts .
maybe I can cut there , see the brain , and I can change my cut .
you can see some internal organs .
so we call this the slicer mode .
OK , I 'm going to do another cut .
right there .
this shows a lot of internal structures .
so if I want to see the back side , I can flip and see from behind .
like this .
so if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you , that means we did the right job .
so our doctors said these are eye candies .
so instead of just butchering the body , I 'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections .
what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to peel off all the skin , muscles and bones , just to see a few internal organs .
right here .
let 's say I 'm going to cut the liver right here .
OK .
let 's say I 'm interested in looking at the heart .
I 'm going to do some surgery here .
I 'm going to cut some veins , arteries . Oops ! ...
you don 't want to hear " oops " in real surgery .
but fortunately , our digital man has " undo . "
OK .
all right then .
let me zoom in .
I 'm going to make a cut right there .
and then you can see the inside of the heart .
you can see the atrium and the ventricles , how blood flows to our arteries and veins .
just like this , students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to .
it doesn 't have to be always dissection .
since it 's digital , we can do reverse dissection .
so let me show you , I 'm going to start with the skeletal structure , and I can add a few internal organs .
Yep .
maybe I can add quickly this way .
and I can build muscles gradually , just like that .
we can see tendons and muscles .
wish I could build my muscle this fast .
and this is another way to learn anatomy .
another thing I can show you is , more often than not , doctors get to meet patients in X-ray form .
so , Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray .
you can also interact with your X-ray , and also if you want , you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray , too .
so when you are done , just bring back the body and then it 's ready for another session .
it looks like our table also can transform gender , too .
it 's a female now .
so this is Anatomage Table . thank you .
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
it all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
they were blank on one side , and on the other side I listed some simple instructions .
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they 'd never told anyone before .
and I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect .
but soon the idea began spreading virally .
people began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox , not just with postmarks from Washington , D.C. , but from Texas , California , Vancouver , New Zealand , Iraq .
soon my crazy idea didn 't seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
and this is my postcard collection today .
you can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
what I 'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
" I found these stamps as a child , and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
I never did have someone . " secrets can take many forms .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
they can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet .
maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don 't know .
this one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard .
this one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side .
" dear birthmother , I have great parents .
I 've found love . I 'm happy . " secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now .
" everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes I 'm dead . " " I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes I didn 't wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . " this next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you .
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
and sometimes afterwards I 'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
and this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
and I should also mention that , just like today , at that PostSecret event , I was using a wireless microphone .
" your mic wasn 't off during sound check .
we all heard you pee . " this was really embarrassing when it happened , until I realized it could have been worse .
right . you know what I 'm saying .
" inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn 't use .
I feel like the happiest person on Earth " " One of these men is the father of my son .
he pays me a lot to keep it a secret . " " that Saturday when you wondered where I was , well , I was getting your ring .
it 's in my pocket right now . " I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine 's Day .
it was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
and it hadn 't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
and he said , " Frank , I 've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . " he said , " My knees are still shaking . "
he said , " For three years , my girlfriend and I , we 've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
I read some to her , she reads some to me . "
he says , " It 's really brought us closer together through the years .
and so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom , I was beside myself .
and I tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
and just like every Sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . "
he said , " But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . " but she finally did .
she got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
and he said , " She read it once and then she read it again . "
and she turned to him and said , " Is that our cat ? " and when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
he popped the question , she said yes . it was a very happy ending .
so I emailed him back and I said , " Please share with me an image , something , that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . "
and he emailed me this picture .
" I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
I finally got the pictures developed and I 'd love to give them to you . " this picture never got returned back to the people who lost it , but this secret has impacted many lives , starting with a student up in Canada named Matty .
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called IFoundYourCamera . Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they 've found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
and Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
and people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they 've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
this one 's my favorite .
Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
and it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people 's lives can be huge .
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
" that 's me , my husband and son .
the other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
thank you for making your site .
these pictures mean more to me than you know .
my son 's birth is on this camera .
he turns four tomorrow . " every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans , sometimes going through language barriers .
this is the last postcard I have to share with you today .
" when people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . " when I posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they 'd been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
they said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
one young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
secrets can take many forms .
they can be shocking or silly or soulful .
they can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we 'll never meet again .
first saved voice message .
it 's somebody 's birthday today Somebody 's birthday today The candles are lighted on somebody 's cake And we 're all invited for somebody 's sake You 're 21 years old today .
have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I 'll say bye for now .
thank you .
I call myself a body architect .
I trained in classical ballet and have a background in architecture and fashion .
as a body architect , I fascinate with the human body and explore how I can transform it .
I worked at Philips Electronics in the far-future design research lab , looking 20 years into the future .
I explored the human skin , and how technology can transform the body .
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo , which is augmented by touch , or dresses that blushed and shivered with light .
I started my own experiments .
these were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having .
these are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue .
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine , Bart Hess -- he doesn 't normally look like this -- and we used ourselves as models .
we transformed our apartments into our laboratories , and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way .
we were creating visual imagery provoking human evolution .
whilst I was at Philips , we discussed this idea of a maybe technology , something that wasn 't either switched on or off , but in between .
a maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid .
and I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body , so you couldn 't see where the skin ended and the near environment started .
I set up my studio in the red-light district and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing , and found a way to redefine the skin and create this dynamic textile .
I was introduced to Robyn , the Swedish pop star , and she was also exploring how technology coexists with raw human emotion .
and she talked about how technology with these new feathers , this new face paint , this punk , the way that we identify with the world , and we made this music video .
I 'm fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology , and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
and I thought about this concept of ,
imagine if we could reprogram our own body odor , modify and biologically enhance it , and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other ?
or the way that we attract sexual partners ?
and would we revert back to being more like animals , more primal modes of communication ?
I worked with a synthetic biologist , and I created a swallowable perfume , which is a cosmetic pill that you eat and the fragrance comes out through the skin 's surface when you perspire .
it completely blows apart the way that perfume is , and provides a whole new format .
it 's perfume coming from the inside out .
it redefines the role of skin , and our bodies become an atomizer .
I 've learned that there 's no boundaries , and if I look at the evolution of my work i can see threads and connections that make sense .
but when I look towards the future , the next project is completely unknown and wide open .
I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me , and it 's these conversations and these experiences that connect these ideas , and they kind of instinctively come out .
as a body architect , I 've created this limitless and boundless platform for me to discover whatever I want .
and I feel like I 've just got started .
so here 's to another day at the office .
last January , my company , Fark.com , was sued along with Yahoo , MSN , Reddit , AOL , TechCrunch and others by a company called Gooseberry Natural Resources .
gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email .
now it may seem kind of strange that such a thing can actually be patented , but it does happen all the time .
take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology -- like phone calls on the internet or video listings for TV shows or radio but for cellphones , and so on .
the problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional , and as a result , most of these lawsuits end in settlements .
and because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement , no one knows what the terms were .
and as a result , the patent troll can claim that they won the case .
in the case of Gooseberry Natural Resources , this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw as it pertained to myself , and that was that in the mainstream media world there is only one definition for news release , and it turns out that is press release -- as in P.R.
now my company , Fark , deals with news , ostensibly , and as a result we were not in violation of this patent .
so case closed , right ?
wrong .
one of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll , the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant , which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on .
and this can take quite a while .
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll .
now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit , but one-by-one they settled out of the case , even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them .
and they started settling out .
the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit -- clearly , two million dollars cheaper in some cases , and much worse if you actually lose .
it would also constitute a massive distraction for management of a company , especially a small eight-man shop like my company .
six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase .
and in discovery phase , we asked the patent troll to please provide screenshots of Fark where the infringement of their patent was actually occurring .
now perhaps it 's because no such screenshots actually existed , but suddenly Gooseberry wanted to settle .
their attorney : " Ah , yes . my company 's having a reorganization on our end . "
never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in Northern L.A. with no employees .
" and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out .
so would you mind giving us your best and final offer ? " my response : " how about nothing ? ! " we didn 't have high hopes for that outcome .
but they settled .
no counter offer .
now , as mentioned before , one of the reasons I can talk to you about this is because there 's no non-disclosure agreement on this case .
now how did that happen ?
well during the settlement process , when we received our copy , I struck it .
my attorney said , " Nah , no chance of that working . "
it came back signed .
now why ? you can call them .
they 're not under NDA either .
now what did I learn from this case ? well , three things .
first of all , if you can , don 't fight the patent , fight the infringement .
patents are very difficult to overturn .
infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
secondly , make it clear from the beginning that either you have no money at all or that you would rather spend money with your attorney fighting the troll than actually giving them the money .
now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements .
if it becomes clear to them that they cannot recover any money , they become less interested in pursuing the case .
finally , make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
it turns out , because they 're paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse .
don 't forget that .
so what does all this mean ?
well to sum up , it boils down to one thing : don 't negotiate with terrorists .
patent trolls have done more damage to the United States economy than any domestic or foreign terrorist organization in history every year .
and what do they do with that money ?
they plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits .
now this is the point in the Talk where I 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system .
and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have different outcomes in mind for the patent system .
the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors .
the hi-tech industry would like stronger protections for producers .
and these goals aren 't necessarily diametrically opposed , but they are at odds .
and as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between .
so unfortunately I 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
however , I did have this idea , and it was kind of good .
and I thought , " I should patent this . "
behold , patent infringement via mobile device -- defined as a computer which is not stationary .
my solution : award me this patent and I will troll them out of existence .
thank you .
I was born in Den Bosch , where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after .
and so I 've always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the 15th century .
and what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion 's influence was waning , and he was sort of wondering , I think , what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion .
and so he painted this famous painting , " The Garden of Earthly Delights , " which some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall , or being humanity without any Fall at all .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn 't tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
much later , as a student , I went to a very different garden , a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees .
this is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
and I discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it .
and at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition .
I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom , and humanity included , was that deep down we are competitors , we are aggressive , we 're all out for our own profit basically .
this is the launch of my book .
I 'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it , but they surely seemed interested in the book .
now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on , I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights .
and so what you see here is two males who have had a fight .
they ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
and about a second after I took the picture , they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other .
now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression , and so it wouldn 't make any sense .
the only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose .
but why would you reconcile after a fight ?
that doesn 't make any sense .
this is the way bonobos do it . bonobos do everything with sex .
and so they also reconcile with sex .
but the principle is exactly the same .
the principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict , so you need to do something about it .
so my whole picture of the animal kingdom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
so we have this image in political science , economics , the humanities , philosophy for that matter , that man is a wolf to man .
and so deep down our nature 's actually nasty .
I think it 's a very unfair image for the wolf .
the wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
and that 's why many of you have a dog at home , which has all these characteristics also .
and it 's really unfair to humanity , because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for .
so I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
so these are the pillars of morality .
if you ask anyone , " What is morality based on ? " these are the two factors that always come out .
one is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
and the other one is empathy and compassion .
and human morality is more than this , but if you would remove these two pillars , there would be not much remaining I think .
and so they 're absolutely essential .
so let me give you a few examples here .
this is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate .
so this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation .
what you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box , and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in .
and of course , there 's food on the box .
otherwise they wouldn 't be pulling so hard .
and so they 're bringing in the box .
and you can see that they 're synchronized .
you can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
it 's already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn 't be able to do that .
and now you 're going to get a more interesting picture , because now one of the two chimps has been fed .
so one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore .
now look at what happens at the very end of this .
he takes basically everything .
so there are two interesting parts about this .
one is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner -- so a full understanding of the need for cooperation .
the second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he 's not interested in the food .
why would that be ? well that probably has to do with reciprocity .
there 's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors .
so he will get a return favor at some point in the future .
and so that 's how this all operates .
we do the same task with elephants .
now with elephants , it 's very dangerous to work with elephants .
another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant .
now you can probably make it , but it 's going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think .
and so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope , a single rope .
and if you pull on this side of the rope , the rope disappears on the other side .
so two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
and the first tape you 're going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus .
the apparatus is on the left with food on it .
and so they come together , they arrive together , they pick it up together and they pull together .
so it 's actually fairly simple for them .
there they are .
and so that 's how they bring it in .
but now we 're going to make it more difficult .
because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation .
do they understand that as well as the chimps , for example ?
and so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope , it disappears and the whole test is over .
now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it .
but it shows the understanding that he has , because he puts his big foot on the rope , stands on the rope and waits there for the other , and then the other is going to do all the work for him .
so it 's what we call freeloading .
but it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
they develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily .
so the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in .
now look at the other . the other doesn 't forget to eat , of course .
this was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
now something on empathy .
empathy is my main topic at the moment of research .
and empathy has sort of two qualities .
one is the understanding part of it . this is just a regular definition : the ability to understand and share the feelings of another .
and the emotional part .
and so empathy has basically two channels .
one is the body channel .
if you talk with a sad person , you 're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture , and before you know it you feel sad .
and that 's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy , which many animals have .
your average dog has that also .
that 's actually why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don 't have that kind of empathy .
and then there 's a cognitive channel , which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else .
and that 's more limited .
there 's few animals -- I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing -- but there are very few animals who can do that .
so synchronization , which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom .
and in humans , of course , we can study that with yawn contagion .
humans yawn when others yawn .
and it 's related to empathy .
it activates the same areas in the brain .
also , we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic .
people who have problems with empathy , such as autistic children , they don 't have yawn contagion .
so it is connected .
and we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head .
so that 's what you see on the upper-left , an animated head that yawns .
and there 's a chimpanzee watching , an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations .
so yawn contagion that you 're probably all familiar with -- and maybe you 're going to start yawning soon now -- is something that we share with other animals .
and that 's related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically .
now we also study more complex expressions . this is consolation .
this is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he 's screaming , and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down .
that 's consolation . it 's very similar to human consolation .
and consolation behavior , it 's empathy driven .
actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed , and then they see what young children do .
and so it is related to empathy , and that 's the kind of expressions we look at .
we also recently published an experiment you may have heard about .
it 's on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is , do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else ?
and for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that , that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else .
now we did a very simple experiment .
we do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville , in the field station of Yerkes .
and so that 's how they live .
and we call them into a room and do experiments with them .
in this case , we put two chimpanzees side-by-side .
and one has a bucket full of tokens , and the tokens have different meanings .
one kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
so this is a study we did with Vicky Horner .
and here you have the two color tokens .
so they have a whole bucket full of them .
and they have to pick one of the two colors .
you will see how that goes .
so if this chimp makes the selfish choice , which is the red token in this case , he needs to give it to us .
so we pick it up , we put it on a table where there 's two food rewards , but in this case only the one on the right gets food .
the one on the left walks away because she knows already. that this is not a good test for her .
then the next one is the pro-social token .
so the one who makes the choices -- that 's the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices , it doesn 't really matter .
so she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed .
so the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
so it doesn 't matter whatsoever .
and she should actually be choosing blindly .
but what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token .
so this is the 50 percent line that 's the random expectation .
and especially if the partner draws attention to itself , they choose more .
and if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down .
it 's as if they 're saying , " If you 're not behaving , I 'm not going to be pro-social today . " and this is what happens without a partner , when there 's no partner sitting there .
and so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
so the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study .
and so this became a very famous study .
and there 's now many more , because after we did this about 10 years ago , it became very well known .
and we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
and I 'm going to show you the first experiment that we did .
it has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees .
but with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys .
so what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side .
again , these animals , they live in a group , they know each other .
we take them out of the group , put them in a test chamber .
and there 's a very simple task that they need to do .
and if you give both of them cucumber for the task , the two monkeys side-by-side , they 're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row .
so cucumber , even though it 's only really water in my opinion , but cucumber is perfectly fine for them .
now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it 's a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
so that 's the experiment we did .
recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who 'd never done the task , thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction , and that turned out to be right .
the one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
the one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
the one who gets cucumber , note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine .
the first piece she eats .
then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
so she gives a rock to us . that 's the task .
and we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it .
the other one needs to give a rock to us .
and that 's what she does .
and she gets a grape and she eats it .
the other one sees that .
she gives a rock to us now , gets , again , cucumber .
she tests a rock now against the wall .
she needs to give it to us .
and she gets cucumber again .
so this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here .
let me tell you -- I still have two minutes left , let me tell you a funny story about this .
this study became very famous and we got a lot of comments , especially anthropologists , economists , philosophers .
they didn 't like this at all .
because they had decided in their minds , I believe , that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it .
and so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution .
now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes .
now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan , who 's been doing this with chimpanzees , had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where , indeed , the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape .
so we 're getting very close to the human sense of fairness .
and I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile .
so let me summarize .
I believe there 's an evolved morality .
I think morality is much more than what I 've been talking about , but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates , which are empathy and consolation , pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness .
and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily God and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved morality .
and I thank you for your attention .
I 'm a process engineer .
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that , but I also have Marfan syndrome .
this is an inherited disorder .
and in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
and as you can see , my aorta dilated progressively , and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary .
the surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you , open your chest , put you on an artificial heart and lung machine , drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade , stop your heart , cut the aorta out , replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta , and , most importantly , commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy , normally warfarin .
the thought of the surgery was not attractive .
the thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
so I said to myself , I 'm an engineer , I 'm in R and D , this is just a plumbing problem .
I can do this . I can change this .
so I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation .
the project aim is really quite simple .
the only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
so the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
and it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
if your high-pressure hose pipe , or your high-pressure hydraulic line , bulges a little , you just wrap some tape around the outside of it .
it really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
the great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits , all of my own endothelium and valves , and not need any anticoagulation therapy .
so where do we start ?
well this is a sagittal slice through me .
you could see in the middle that device , that little structure , squeezing out .
now that 's a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta .
and it 's that part , the ascending aorta , which dilates and ultimately bursts , which , of course , is fatal .
we started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and CT imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient 's aorta .
this is a model of my aorta .
I 've got a real one in my pocket , if anyone would like to look at it and play with it .
you can see , it 's quite a complex structure .
it has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom , which contains the aortic valve .
it then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off .
so it 's quite a difficult structure to produce .
this , like I say , is a CAD model of me , and this is one of the later CAD models .
we went through an iterative process of producing better and better models .
when we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model , as you can see ,
using a rapid prototyping technique , another engineering technique .
we then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta .
so this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
once you 've made it , the installation 's quite easy .
John Pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn 't like it , took it out , put the second one in .
happy , away I went .
four and a half hours on the table and everything was done .
so the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
if you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative , the so-called composite aortic root graft , there are one of two startling comparisons , which I 'm sure will be clear to all of you .
two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment .
the existing treatment requires , as I 've said , the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling .
we don 't need any of that ; we work on a beating heart .
he opens you up , he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating , all at the right temperature .
no breaking into your circulatory system .
so it really is great .
but for me , absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required .
I don 't take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take .
and in fact , if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin , it is a serious compromise to your quality of life .
and even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
likewise , if you have the artificial valve option , you 're committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all .
even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve .
again , I don 't have any of that , so I 'm entirely free .
my aorta is fixed , I haven 't got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
back to the theme of the presentation : in multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
this is a list of the core team .
and as you can see , there are not only two principal technical disciplines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines .
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me , but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another .
Raad Mohiaddin , medical radiologist : we had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model .
Warren Thornton , who still does all our CAD models for us , had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set .
there are some barriers to this though . there are some problems with it .
jargon is a big one .
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there .
the engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
the medics amongst you , if there are any , will recognize the first two .
but there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words .
taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used .
our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
we took a lot of horizontal slice images through me , produced those slices and then used those to build a CAD model .
and the very first CAD model we made , the surgeons were playing with the plastic model , couldn 't quite figure it out .
and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
and it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans , plans of houses or streets or maps .
in the medical world they look up at plans .
so the horizontal images were all an inversion .
so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed .
institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
the Brompton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College 's School of Medicine , and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations .
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn 't exist .
research and ethics committee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
I 'm sure it 's the same in Poland .
there will be some form of equivalent , which licenses new types of surgery .
we didn 't only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , was also had professional jealousies .
there were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn 't want to see John Pepper succeed again , because he 's so successful .
and they made extra problems for us .
bureaucratic problems : ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country .
in the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , NICE .
you 'll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
we had to get past the NICE problem .
we now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
so any of the hospitals interested can come along , read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves .
funding barriers : another big area to be concerned with . a big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : when we first approached one of the big U.K. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
they didn 't understand it ; they were doctors , they were next to God .
it must be rubbish . they binned it .
so in the end I went to private investors and I just gave up on it .
but most R and D is going to be institutionally funded , by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever , and you need to get past those people .
jargon is a huge problem when you 're trying to work across disciplines , because in an engineering world , we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world .
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together .
they 've really got to start talking to each other , and they 've got to exercise a bit of imagination , if that 's not too much to ask -- which it probably is .
I 've coined a phrase " obstructive conservatism . "
so many people in the medical world don 't want to change , particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer .
they don 't want to change .
they simply want to do whatever they 've done before .
and in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K. still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode , so that they can say , " Ah , I told you that was no good . " we 've actually got 30 patients .
I 'm at seven and a half years .
we 've got 90 post-op patient years between us , and we haven 't had a single problem .
and still , there are people in the U.K. saying , " Yeah , that external aortic root , yeah , it 'll never work , you know . " it really is a problem . it really is a problem .
I 'm sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics , doctors , surgeons at some point .
the middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves .
" Yeah , well of course , I 'm looking after my patient . "
I think it 's not good , but there you are , that 's my view .
egos , of course , again , a huge problem If you 're working in a multidisciplinary team , you 've got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
you 've got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
dead easy to give him respect .
him giving me respect ? slightly different .
that 's all the bad news .
the good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
translate that one . I bet they can 't .
when you have a group of people who have had a different professional training , a different professional experience , they not only have a different knowledge base , but they have a different perspective on everything .
and if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other , the results can be spectacular .
you can find novel solutions , really novel solutions , that have never been looked at before very , very quickly and easily .
you can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
and as a result , it 's an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
the result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets .
I 'm so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I 'm not prepared to tell you what it cost .
because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality .
that 's all I want to say , and I 've got three minutes left .
so Heather 's going to like me .
if you have any questions , please come up and talk to me later on .
it would be a pleasure to speak with you . many thanks .
just a moment ago , my daughter Rebecca texted me for good luck .
her text said , " Mom , you will rock . " I love this .
getting that text was like getting a hug .
I embody the central paradox .
I 'm a woman who loves getting texts who 's going to tell you that too many of them can be a problem .
actually that reminder of my daughter brings me to the beginning of my story .
1996 , when I gave my first TEDTalk , Rebecca was five years old and she was sitting right there in the front row .
I had just written a book that celebrated our life on the internet and I was about to be on the cover of Wired magazine .
in those heady days , we were experimenting with chat rooms and online virtual communities .
we were exploring different aspects of ourselves .
and then we unplugged .
I was excited .
and , as a psychologist , what excited me most was the idea that we would use what we learned in the virtual world about ourselves , about our identity , to live better lives in the real world .
now fast-forward to 2012 .
I 'm back here on the TED stage again .
my daughter 's 20 . she 's a college student .
she sleeps with her cellphone , so do I.
and I 've just written a new book , but this time it 's not one that will get me on the cover of Wired magazine .
so what happened ?
I 'm still excited by technology , but I believe , and I 'm here to make the case , that we 're letting it take us places that we don 't want to go .
over the past 15 years , I 've studied technologies of mobile communication and I 've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people , young and old , about their plugged in lives .
and what I 've found is that our little devices , those little devices in our pockets , are so psychologically powerful that they don 't only change what we do , they change who we are .
some of the things we do now with our devices are things that , only a few years ago , we would have found odd or disturbing , but they 've quickly come to seem familiar , just how we do things .
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
they text and shop and go on Facebook during classes , during presentations , actually during all meetings .
people talk to me about the important new skill of making eye contact while you 're texting .
people explain to me that it 's hard , but that it can be done .
parents text and do email at breakfast and at dinner while their children complain about not having their parents ' full attention .
but then these same children deny each other their full attention .
this is a recent shot of my daughter and her friends being together while not being together .
and we even text at funerals .
I study this .
we remove ourselves from our grief or from our revery and we go into our phones .
why does this matter ?
it matters to me because I think we 're setting ourselves up for trouble -- trouble certainly in how we relate to each other , but also trouble in how we relate to ourselves and our capacity for self-reflection .
we 're getting used to a new way of being alone together .
people want to be with each other , but also elsewhere -- connected to all the different places they want to be .
people want to customize their lives .
they want to go in and out of all the places they are because the thing that matters most to them is control over where they put their attention .
so you want to go to that board meeting , but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you .
and some people think that 's a good thing .
but you can end up hiding from each other , even as we 're all constantly connected to each other .
a 50-year-old business man lamented to me that he feels he doesn 't have colleagues anymore at work .
when he goes to work , he doesn 't stop by to talk to anybody , he doesn 't call .
and he says he doesn 't want to interrupt his colleagues because , he says , " They 're too busy on their email . " but then he stops himself and he says , " You know , I 'm not telling you the truth .
I 'm the one who doesn 't want to be interrupted .
I think I should want to , but actually I 'd rather just do things on my Blackberry . " across the generations , I see that people can 't get enough of each other , if and only if they can have each other at a distance , in amounts they can control .
I call it the Goldilocks effect : not too close , not too far , just right .
but what might feel just right for that middle-aged executive can be a problem for an adolescent who needs to develop face-to-face relationships .
an 18-year-old boy who uses texting for almost everything says to me wistfully , " Someday , someday , but certainly not now , I 'd like to learn how to have a conversation . " when I ask people " What 's wrong with having a conversation ? " people say , " I 'll tell you what 's wrong with having a conversation .
it takes place in real time and you can 't control what you 're going to say . " so that 's the bottom line .
texting , email , posting , all of these things let us present the self as we want to be .
we get to edit , and that means we get to delete , and that means we get to retouch , the face , the voice , the flesh , the body -- not too little , not too much , just right .
human relationships are rich and they 're messy and they 're demanding .
and we clean them up with technology .
and when we do , one of the things that can happen is that we sacrifice conversation for mere connection .
we short-change ourselves .
and over time , we seem to forget this , or we seem to stop caring .
I was caught off guard when Stephen Colbert asked me a profound question , a profound question .
he said , " Don 't all those little tweets , don 't all those little sips of online communication , add up to one big gulp of real conversation ? " my answer was no , they don 't add up .
connecting in sips may work for gathering discreet bits of information , they may work for saying , " I 'm thinking about you , " or even for saying , " I love you , " -- I mean , look at how I felt when I got that text from my daughter -- but they don 't really work for learning about each other , for really coming to know and understand each other .
and we use conversations with each other to learn how to have conversations with ourselves .
so a flight from conversation can really matter because it can compromise our capacity for self-reflection .
for kids growing up , that skill is the bedrock of development .
over and over I hear , " I would rather text than talk . " and what I 'm seeing is that people get so used to being short-changed out of real conversation , so used to getting by with less , that they 've become almost willing to dispense with people altogether .
so for example , many people share with me this wish , that some day a more advanced version of Siri , the digital assistant on Apple 's iPhone , will be more like a best friend , someone who will listen when others won 't .
I believe this wish reflects a painful truth that I 've learned in the past 15 years .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
that 's why it 's so appealing to have a Facebook page or a Twitter feed -- so many automatic listeners . and the feeling that no one is listening to me make us want to spend time with machines that seem to care about us .
we 're developing robots , they call them sociable robots , that are specifically designed to be companions -- to the elderly , to our children , to us .
have we so lost confidence that we will be there for each other ?
during my research I worked in nursing homes , and I brought in these sociable robots that were designed to give the elderly the feeling that they were understood .
and one day I came in and a woman who had lost a child was talking to a robot in the shape of a baby seal .
it seemed to be looking in her eyes .
it seemed to be following the conversation .
it comforted her .
and many people found this amazing .
but that woman was trying to make sense of her life with a machine that had no experience of the arc of a human life .
that robot put on a great show .
and we 're vulnerable .
people experience pretend empathy as though it were the real thing .
so during that moment when that woman was experiencing that pretend empathy , I was thinking , " That robot can 't empathize .
it doesn 't face death .
it doesn 't know life . " and as that woman took comfort in her robot companion , I didn 't find it amazing ; I found it one of the most wrenching , complicated moments in my 15 years of work .
but when I stepped back , I felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm .
we expect more from technology and less from each other .
and I ask myself , " Why have things come to this ? " and I believe it 's because technology appeals to us most where we are most vulnerable .
and we are vulnerable .
we 're lonely , but we 're afraid of intimacy .
and so from social networks to sociable robots , we 're designing technologies that will give us the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship .
we turn to technology to help us feel connected in ways we can comfortably control .
but we 're not so comfortable .
we are not so much in control .
these days , those phones in our pockets are changing our minds and hearts because they offer us three gratifying fantasies .
one , that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be ; two , that we will always be heard ; and three , that we will never have to be alone .
and that third idea , that we will never have to be alone , is central to changing our psyches .
because the moment that people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become anxious , they panic , they fidget , they reach for a device .
just think of people at a checkout line or at a red light .
being alone feels like a problem that needs to be solved .
and so people try to solve it by connecting .
but here , connection is more like a symptom than a cure .
it expresses , but it doesn 't solve , an underlying problem .
but more than a symptom , constant connection is changing the way people think of themselves .
it 's shaping a new way of being .
the best way to describe it is , I share therefore I am .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we 're having them .
so before it was : I have a feeling , I want to make a call .
now it 's : I want to have a feeling , I need to send a text .
the problem with this new regime of " I share therefore I am " is that , if we don 't have connection , we don 't feel like ourselves . we almost don 't feel ourselves . so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
but in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated .
how do you get from connection to isolation ?
you end up isolated if you don 't cultivate the capacity for solitude , the ability to be separate , to gather yourself .
solitude is where you find yourself so that you can reach out to other people and form real attachments .
when we don 't have the capacity for solitude , we turn to other people in order to feel less anxious or in order to feel alive .
when this happens , we 're not able to appreciate who they are .
it 's as though we 're using them as spare parts to support our fragile sense of self .
we slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us fell less alone .
but we 're at risk , because actually it 's the opposite that 's true .
if we 're not able to be alone , we 're going to be more lonely .
and if we don 't teach our children to be alone , they 're only going to know When I spoke at TED in 1996 , reporting on my studies of the early virtual communities , I said , " Those who make the most of their lives on the screen come to it in a spirit of self-reflection . " and that 's what I 'm calling for here , now : reflection and , more than that , a conversation about where our current use of technology may be taking us , what it might be costing us .
we 're smitten with technology .
and we 're afraid , like young lovers , that too much talking might spoil the romance .
but it 's time to talk .
we grew up with digital technology and so we see it as all grown up .
but it 's not , it 's early days .
there 's plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it , how we build it .
I 'm not suggesting that we turn away from our devices , just that we develop a more self-aware relationship with them , with each other and with ourselves .
I see some first steps .
start thinking of solitude as a good thing .
make room for it .
find ways to demonstrate this as a value to your children .
create sacred spaces at home -- the kitchen , the dining room -- and reclaim them for conversation .
do the same thing at work .
at work , we 're so busy communicating that we often don 't have time to think , we don 't have time to talk , about the things that really matter .
change that .
most important , we all really need to listen to each other , including to the boring bits .
because it 's when we stumble or hesitate or lose our words that we reveal ourselves to each other .
technology is making a bid to redefine human connection -- how we care for each other , how we care for ourselves -- but it 's also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction .
I 'm optimistic .
we have everything we need to start .
we have each other .
and we have the greatest chance of success if we recognize our vulnerability .
that we listen when technology says it will take something complicated and promises something simpler .
so in my work , I hear that life is hard , relationships are filled with risk .
and then there 's technology -- simpler , hopeful , optimistic , ever-young .
it 's like calling in the cavalry .
an ad campaign promises that online and with avatars , you can " Finally , love your friends love your body , love your life , online and with avatars . " we 're drawn to virtual romance , to computer games that seem like worlds , to the idea that robots , robots , will someday be our true companions .
we spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends .
but our fantasies of substitution have cost us .
now we all need to focus on the many , many ways technology can lead us back to our real lives , our own bodies , our own communities , our own politics , our own planet .
they need us .
let 's talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
thank you .
I got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee , as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything .
so the natural question you ask then at that point is , how do I get good at what I 'm trying to do ?
and it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we 're trying to do ?
it 's hard enough to learn to get the skills , try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you 're taking on .
I had to think about how I sew and how I cut , but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room .
and then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good .
in the last few years we realized we were in the deepest crisis of medicine 's existence due to something you don 't normally think about when you 're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people , which is the cost of health care .
there 's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do .
the political fight that we 've developed has become one around whether it 's the government that 's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem .
and the answer is yes and no ; it 's deeper than all of that .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
and in order to understand this , I 'm going to take you back a couple of generations .
I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book , " The Youngest Science . "
Lewis Thomas was a physician-writer , one of my favorite writers .
and he wrote this book to explain , among other things , what it was like to be a medical intern at the Boston City Hospital in the pre-penicillin year of 1937 .
it was a time when medicine was cheap and very ineffective .
if you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth , some food , shelter , and maybe the caring attention of a nurse .
doctors and medicine made no difference at all .
that didn 't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days , as he explained .
what they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses for which they could do something .
and there were a few .
you might have a lobar pneumonia , for example , and they could give you an antiserum , an injection of rabid antibodies to the bacterium streptococcus , if the intern sub-typed it correctly .
if you had an acute congestive heart failure , they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein , giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
if you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions , you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis , in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic -- as long as you didn 't overdose them and kill them .
beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn 't have a lot that they could do .
this was when the core structure of medicine was created -- what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be .
it was at a time when what was known you could know , you could hold it all in your head , and you could do it all .
if you had a prescription pad , if you had a nurse , if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce , maybe some basic tools , you really could do it all .
you set the fracture , you drew the blood , you spun the blood , looked at it under the microscope , you plated the culture , you injected the antiserum .
this was a life as a craftsman .
as a result , we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring , at being courageous , at being independent and self-sufficient .
autonomy was our highest value .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
we can 't cure it all .
we can 't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
but we can make it possible for most .
but what does it take ?
well , we 've now discovered 4,000 medical and surgical procedures .
we 've discovered 6,000 drugs that I 'm now licensed to prescribe .
and we 're trying to deploy this capability , town by town , to every person alive -- in our own country , let alone around the world .
and we 've reached the point where we 've realized , as doctors , we can 't know it all .
we can 't do it all by ourselves .
there was a study where they looked at how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital , as it changed over time .
and in the year 1970 , it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians .
it took basically the nursing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day .
by the end of the 20th century , it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient -- specialists , physical therapists , the nurses .
we 're all specialists now , even the primary care physicians .
everyone just has a piece of the care .
but holding onto that structure we built around the daring , independence , self-sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster .
we have trained , hired and rewarded people to be cowboys .
but it 's pit crews that we need , pit crews for patients .
there 's evidence all around us : 40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
60 percent of our asthma , stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn 't have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to -- hardworking , incredibly well-trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
there 's another sign that we need pit crews , and that 's the unmanageable cost of our care .
now we in medicine , I think , are baffled by this question of cost .
we want to say , " This is just the way it is .
this is just what medicine requires . " when you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin , that mostly didn 't do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $ 40,000 hip replacement replacing the 10-cent aspirin is more expensive ?
it 's just the way it is .
but I think we 're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
as we 've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased , we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care .
and vice versa , the best care often turns out to be the least expensive -- has fewer complications , the people get more efficient at what they do .
and what that means is there 's hope .
because [ if ] to have the best results , you really needed the most expensive care in the country , or in the world , well then we really would be talking about rationing who we 're going to cut off from Medicare .
that would be really our only choice .
but when we look at the positive deviants -- the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs -- we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful .
that is to say , they found ways to get all of the different pieces , all of the different components , to come together into a whole .
having great components is not enough , and yet we 've been obsessed in medicine with components .
we want the best drugs , the best technologies , the best specialists , but we don 't think too much about how it all comes together .
it 's a terrible design strategy actually .
there 's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said , what if you built a car from the very best car parts ?
well it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes , a Ferrari engine , a Volvo body , a BMW chassis .
and you put it all together and what do you get ?
a very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere .
and that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
it 's not a system .
now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
when you are a specialist , you can 't see the end result very well .
you have to become really interested in data , unsexy as that sounds .
one of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , and he got interested in the question of , well how many CT scans did they do for their community in Cedar Rapids ?
he got interested in this because there had been government reports , newspaper reports , journal articles saying that there had been too many CT scans done .
he didn 't see it in his own patients .
and so he asked the question , " How many did we do ? " and he wanted to get the data .
it took him three months .
no one had asked this question in his community before .
and what he found was that , for the 300,000 people in their community , in the previous year they had done 52,000 CT scans .
they had found a problem .
which brings us to skill number two a system has .
skill one , find where your failures are .
skill two is devise solutions .
I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery .
the volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training , give people more specialization or bring in more technology .
well in surgery , you couldn 't have people who are more specialized and you couldn 't have people who are better trained .
and yet we see unconscionable levels of death , disability that could be avoided .
and so we looked at what other high-risk industries do .
we looked at skyscraper construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : they have checklists .
I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about checklists .
and yet , what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better .
we got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us .
could we design a checklist for surgery ?
not for the lowest people on the totem pole , but for the folks who were all the way around the chain , the entire team including the surgeons .
and what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood .
you have to think about things like pause points .
you need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it 's a danger and do something about it .
you have to identify that this is a before-takeoff checklist .
and then you need to focus on the killer items .
an aviation checklist , like this one for a single-engine plane , isn 't a recipe for how to fly a plane , it 's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they 're not checked .
so we did this .
we created a 19-item two-minute checklist
for surgical teams .
we had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given , immediately before the knife hits the skin , immediately before the patient leaves the room .
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there -- making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half -- and then interesting stuff , because you can 't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery .
instead , you can make a recipe for how to have a team that 's prepared for the unexpected .
and we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day , because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you 're coming in .
we implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural Tanzania to the University of Washington in Seattle .
we found that after they adopted it the complication rates fell 35 percent .
it fell in every hospital it went into .
the death rates fell 47 percent .
this was bigger than a drug .
and that brings us to skill number three , the ability to implement this , to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things .
and it 's been slow to spread .
this is not yet our norm in surgery -- let alone making checklists to go onto childbirth and other areas .
there 's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we 're not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we 've had , like humility , discipline , teamwork .
this is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self-sufficiency , autonomy .
I met an actual cowboy , by the way .
I asked him , what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles ?
how did you do that ?
and he said , " We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around . " they communicate electronically constantly , and they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything -- -- from bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle .
even the cowboys are pit crews now .
and it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists .
but I would go further and say that making systems work , whether in health care , education , climate change , making a pathway out of poverty , is the great task of our generation as a whole .
in every field , knowledge has exploded , but it has brought complexity , it has brought specialization .
and we 've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individualistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success .
we all need to be pit crews now .
thank you .
people are living longer and societies are getting grayer .
you hear about it all the time .
you read about it in your newspapers .
you hear about it on your television sets .
sometimes I 'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we 've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency , even ease .
but make no mistake , longer lives can and , I believe , will improve quality of life at all ages .
now to put this in perspective , let me just zoom out for a minute .
more years were added to average life expectancy in the 20th century than all years added across all prior millennia of human evolution combined . in the blink of an eye , we nearly doubled the length of time that we 're living .
so if you ever feel like you don 't have this aging thing quite pegged , don 't kick yourself .
it 's brand new .
and because fertility rates fell across that very same period that life expectancy was going up , that pyramid that has always represented the distribution of age in the population , with many young ones at the bottom winnowed to a tiny peak of older people who make it and survive to old age is being reshaped into a rectangle .
and now , if you 're the kind of person who can get chills from population statistics , these are the ones that should do it .
because what that means is that for the first time in the history of the species , the majority of babies born in the Developed World are having the opportunity to grow old .
how did this happen ?
well we 're no genetically hardier than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago .
this increase in life expectancy is the remarkable product of culture -- the crucible that holds science and technology and wide-scale changes in behavior that improve health and well-being .
through cultural changes , our ancestors largely eliminated early death so that people can now live out their full lives .
now there are problems associated with aging -- diseases , poverty , loss of social status .
it 's hardly time to rest on our laurels .
but the more we learn about aging , the clearer it becomes that a sweeping downward course is grossly inaccurate .
aging brings some rather remarkable improvements -- increased knowledge , expertise -- and emotional aspects of life improve .
that 's right , older people are happy .
they 're happier than middle-aged people , and younger people certainly .
study after study is coming to the same conclusion .
the CDC recently conducted a survey where they asked respondents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psychological distress in the previous week .
and fewer older people answered affirmatively to that question than middle-aged people , and younger people as well .
and a recent Gallup poll asked participants how much stress and worry and anger they had experienced the previous day .
and stress , worry , anger all decrease with age .
now social scientists call this the paradox of aging .
after all , aging is not a piece of cake .
so we 've asked all sorts of questions to see if we could undo this finding .
we 've asked whether it may be that the current generations of older people are and always have been the greatest generations .
that is that younger people today may not typically experience these improvements as they grow older .
we 've asked , well maybe older people are just trying to put a positive spin on an otherwise depressing existence .
but the more we 've tried to disavow this finding , the more evidence we find to support it .
years ago , my colleagues and I embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period .
originally the sample was aged 18 to 94 .
and we studied whether and how their emotional experiences changed as they grew older .
our participants would carry electronic pagers for a week at a time , and we 'd page them throughout the day and evenings at random times .
and every time we paged them we 'd ask them to answer several questions -- On a one to seven scale , how happy are you right now ?
how sad are you right now ?
how frustrated are you right now ? -- so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day-to-day lives .
and using this intense study of individuals , we find that it 's not one particular generation that 's doing better than the others , but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience .
now you see this slight downturn at very advanced ages .
and there is a slight downturn .
but at no point does it return to the levels we see in early adulthood .
now it 's really too simplistic to say that older people are " happy . "
in our study , they are more positive , but they 're also more likely than younger people to experience mixed emotions -- sadness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that tear in the eye when you 're smiling at a friend .
and other research has shown that older people seem to engage with sadness more comfortably .
they 're more accepting of sadness than younger people are .
and we suspect that this may help to explain why older people are better than younger people at solving hotly-charged emotional conflicts and debates .
older people can view injustice with compassion , but not despair .
and all things being equal , older people direct their cognitive resources , like attention and memory , to positive information more than negative .
if we show older , middle-aged , younger people images , like the ones you see on the screen , and we later ask them to recall all the images that they can , older people , but not younger people , remember more positive images than negative images .
we 've asked older and younger people to view faces in laboratory studies , some frowning , some smiling . older people look toward the smiling faces and away from the frowning , angry faces .
in day-to-day life , this translates into greater enjoyment and satisfaction .
but as social scientists , we continue to ask about possible alternatives .
we 've said , well maybe older people report more positive emotions because they 're cognitively impaired .
we 've said , could it be that positive emotions are simply easier to process than negative emotions , and so you switch to the positive emotions ?
maybe our neural centers in our brain are degraded such that we 're unable to process negative emotions anymore .
but that 's not the case .
the most mentally sharp older adults are the ones who show this positivity effect the most .
and under conditions where it really matters , older people do process the negative information just as well as the positive information .
so how can this be ?
well in our research , we 've found that these changes are grounded fundamentally in the uniquely human ability to monitor time -- not just clock time and calendar time , but lifetime .
and if there 's a paradox of aging , it 's that recognizing that we won 't live forever changes our perspective on life in positive ways .
when time horizons are long and nebulous , as they typically are in youth , people are constantly preparing , trying to soak up all the information they possibly can , taking risks , exploring .
we might spend time with people we don 't even like because it 's somehow interesting .
we might learn something unexpected .
we go on blind dates .
you know , after all , if it doesn 't work out , there 's always tomorrow .
people over 50 don 't go on blind dates .
as we age , our time horizons grow shorter and our goals change .
when we recognize that we don 't have all the time in the world , we see our priorities most clearly .
we take less notice of trivial matters .
we savor life .
we 're more appreciative , more open to reconciliation .
we invest in more emotionally important parts of life , and life gets better , so we 're happier day-to-day .
but that same shift in perspective leads us to have less tolerance than ever for injustice .
by 2015 , there will be more people in the United States over the age of 60 than under 15 .
what will happen to societies that are top-heavy with older people ?
the numbers won 't determine the outcome .
culture will .
if we invest in science and technology and find solutions for the real problems that older people face and we capitalize on the very real strengths of older people , then added years of life can dramatically improve quality of life at all ages .
societies with millions of talented , emotionally stable citizens who are healthier and better educated than any generations before them , armed with knowledge about the practical matters of life and motivated to solve the big issues can be better societies than we have ever known .
my father , who is 92 , likes to say , " Let 's stop talking only about how to save the old folks and start talking about how to get them to save us all . "
thank you .
so I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
and a lot of us resonate with this phrase .
so we see it in religions and self-help books , that money can 't buy happiness .
and I want to suggest today that , in fact , that 's wrong .
I 'm at a business school , so that 's what we do .
so that 's wrong , and , in fact , if you think that , you 're actually just not spending it right .
so that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it , maybe if you spent it differently , that might work a little bit better .
and before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier , let 's think about the ways we usually spend it that don 't , in fact , make us happier .
we had a little natural experiment .
so CNN , a little while ago , wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery .
it turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing .
this article 's about how their lives get ruined .
so what happens when people win the lottery is , number one , they spend all the money and go into debt , and number two , all of their friends and everyone they 've ever met find them and bug them for money .
and it ruins their social relationships , in fact .
so they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery .
what was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article , readers of the thing .
and instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn 't lead to happiness , everyone instantly started saying , " You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ? " and fantasizing about what they 'd do .
and here 's just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about .
one person wrote in , " When I win , I 'm going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . " and another person wrote , " I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . " this is even worse now : " then I 'd have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made .
anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . " and so many of the comments were exactly of this type , where people got money and , in fact , it made them antisocial .
so I told you that it ruins people 's lives and that their friends bug them .
it also , money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves .
well maybe the reason that money doesn 't make us happy is that we 're always spending it on the wrong things , and in particular , that we 're always spending it on ourselves .
and we thought , I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people .
so instead of being antisocial with your money , what if you were a little more prosocial with your money ?
and we thought , let 's make people do it and see what happens .
so let 's have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let 's make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happier .
so the first way that we did this .
on one Vancouver morning , we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said , " Do you want to be in an experiment ? " they said , " Yes . " we asked them how happy they were , and then we gave them an envelope .
and one of the envelopes had things in it that said , " By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on yourself . " so we gave some examples of what you could spend it on .
other people , in the morning , got a slip of paper that said , " By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on somebody else . " also inside the envelope was money .
and we manipulated how much money we gave them .
so some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
we let them go about their day . they did whatever they wanted to do .
we found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to .
we called them up at night and asked them , " What 'd you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? " what did they spend it on ?
well these are college undergrads , so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup .
one woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece .
people gave money to homeless people .
huge effect here of Starbucks .
so if you give undergraduates five dollars , it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can .
but some people bought a coffee for themselves , the way they usually would , but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else .
so the very same purchase , just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else .
what did we find when we called them back at the end of the day ?
people who spent money on other people got happier .
people who spent money on themselves , nothing happened .
it didn 't make them less happy , it just didn 't do much for them .
and the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn 't matter that much .
so people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars .
in fact , it doesn 't matter how much money you spent .
what really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself .
we see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves .
of course , these are undergraduates in Canada -- not the world 's most representative population .
they 're also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
we wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries .
so we went , in fact , to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
so imagine , instead of just people in Canada , we said , " Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people .
describe it . how happy did it make you ? " or in Uganda , " Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that . " and then we asked them how happy they are again .
and what we see is sort of amazing because there 's human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well .
so for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
he said , " I called a girl I wished to love . " they basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn 't " achieve " her up till now .
here 's a guy from Canada .
very similar thing .
" I took my girlfriend out for dinner .
we went to a movie , we left early , and then went back to her room for ... " only cake -- just a piece of cake .
human universal -- so you spend money on other people , you 're being nice to them .
maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
but then we see extraordinary differences .
so look at these two .
this is a woman from Canada .
we say , " Name a time you spent money on somebody else . " she says , " I bought a present for my mom .
I drove to the mall in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom . " perfectly nice thing to do .
it 's good to get gifts for people that you know .
compare that to this woman from Uganda .
" I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria .
they had no money , they went to a clinic and I gave her this money . " this isn 't $ 10,000 , it 's the local currency .
so it 's a very small amount of money , in fact .
but enormously different motivations here .
this is a real medical need , literally a life-saving donation .
above , it 's just kind of , I bought a gift for my mother .
what we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn 't nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy , which is really quite important .
so you don 't have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy .
you can do small , trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this .
these are only two countries .
we also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness .
we got data from the Gallup Organization , which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately .
they ask people , " Did you donate money to charity recently ? " and they ask them , " How happy are you with your life in general ? " and we can see what the relationship is between those two things .
are they positively correlated ? giving money makes you happy .
or are they negatively correlated ?
on this map , green will mean they 're positively correlated and red means they 're negatively correlated .
and you can see , the world is crazily green .
so in almost every country in the world where we have this data , people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don 't give money to charity .
I know you 're all looking at that red country in the middle .
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it 's Central African Republic .
you can make up stories . maybe it 's different there for some reason or another .
just below that to the right is Rwanda though , which is amazingly green .
so almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself .
what about your work life , which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we 're not with the people we know .
we decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing .
so these are sales teams in Belgium .
they work in teams ; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs .
so we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
some teams , we give people on the team some money for themselves and say , " Spend it however you want on yourself , " just like we did with the undergrads in Canada .
but other teams we say , " Here 's 15 euro .
spend it on one of your teammates this week .
buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them .
and then we can see , well now we 've got teams that spend on themselves and we 've got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better .
the reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that .
a very silly , trivial thing to do , but think of the difference on a team that didn 't do that at all , that got 15 euro , put it in their pocket , maybe bought themselves a coffee , or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity .
what we see is that , in fact , the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves .
and one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves , they put it in their pocket , they don 't do anything different than they did before .
you don 't get any money from that .
you actually lose money because it doesn 't motivate them to perform any better .
but when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates , they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money .
and I realize that you 're probably thinking to yourselves , this is all fine , but there 's a context that 's incredibly important for public policy and I can 't imagine it would work there .
and basically that if he doesn 't show me that it works here , I don 't believe anything he said .
and I know what you 're all thinking about are dodgeball teams .
this was a huge criticism that we got to say , if you can 't show it with dodgeball teams , this is all stupid .
so we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them .
and we did the exact same thing as before .
so some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
the teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before .
the teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they dominate the league by the time they 're done .
across all of these different contexts -- your personal life , you work life , even silly things like intramural sports -- we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself .
and so I 'll just say , I think if you think money can 't buy happiness you 're not spending it right .
the implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that 's the way to make yourself happier .
it 's in fact , that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead .
and we luckily have an opportunity for you .
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools .
they post projects , so they say , " I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don 't have the books , " or " I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don 't have a microscope . "
you and I can go on and buy it for them .
the teacher writes you a thank you note . the kids write you a thank you note .
sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
it 's an extraordinary thing .
go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking , again , less about " How can I spend money on myself ? " and more about " If I 've got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can I do to benefit other people ? " because ultimately when you do that , you 'll find that you 'll benefit yourself much more .
thank you .
have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque ?
probably not , but people like me do .
I 'm an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich , and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
and through this work , I hope to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human DNA from ancient bones .
and from these extracts , we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations , risk factors and inherited diseases .
but this is only one half of the story .
the most important health challenges today are not caused by simple mutations in our genome , but rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites and our immune response .
all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved .
and in order to understand these diseases , we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
and first of all , what do we even study ?
skeletons are ubiquitous ; they 're found all over the place .
but of course , all of the soft tissue has decomposed , and the skeleton itself has limited health information .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
coprolites are fossilized human feces , and they 're actually extremely interesting .
you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
so to address this problem , I put together a team of international researchers in Switzerland , Denmark and the U.K.
to study a very poorly studied , little known material that 's found on people everywhere .
it 's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
many of you may know it by the term tartar .
it 's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit .
and in a typical dentistry visit , you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed .
but in ancient times before tooth brushing , up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime .
and what 's really important about dental calculus is that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton , it 's abundant in quantity before the present day and it 's ubiquitous worldwide .
we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years .
and we even find it in neanderthals and animals .
and so previous studies had only focused on microscopy .
they 'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they 'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
and so what my team of researchers , what we wanted to do , is say , can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after DNA and proteins , and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what 's going on ?
and what we found is that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria that inhabited the nasal passages and mouth .
we also have found immune proteins related to infection and inflammation and proteins and DNA related to diet .
but what was surprising to us , and also quite exciting , is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems .
so it gives us virtual access to the lungs , which is where many important diseases reside .
and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that , from the skeleton alone , has long decomposed .
and so by applying ancient DNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity thousands of years ago .
so what started out as an idea , is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens .
and from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick .
and I hope I have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
and as a final parting thought , on behalf of future archeologists , I would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth .
everything I do , and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
from 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I 'm not - -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
and I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , " Ripples from the Zambezi , " was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
so we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , " Thank God we 're here . "
" just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . "
and of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in Zambia , to this size .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , " Look how easy agriculture is . "
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything .
and we said to the Zambians , " My God , the hippos ! "
and the Zambians said , " Yes , that 's why we have no agriculture here . "
" why didn 't you tell us ? " " you never asked . "
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
you should see the rubbish - -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .
you want to read the book , read " Dead Aid , " by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist .
the book was published in 2009 .
we Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
just go and read her book .
read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
we Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : we either patronize them , or we are paternalistic .
the two words come from the Latin root " pater , " which means " father . "
but they mean two different things .
paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . " I love you so much . "
patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
that 's why the white people in Africa are called " bwana , " boss .
I was given a slap in the face reading a book , " Small is Beautiful , " written by Schumacher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
this should be the first principle of aid .
the first principle of aid is respect .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , " Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? "
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
so what you do -- you shut up .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
we have zero infrastructure .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
if that person doesn 't want to do it , what are you going to do ?
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
so years and years ago , I had this idea : why don 't we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don 't , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
let me tell you a secret .
there is a problem with community meetings .
entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
so planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people in your community you don 't even know , because they don 't come to your public meetings .
what we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
you have to create a new profession .
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
and so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , " You the guy who helped Maori ? can you help us ? "
and I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , " Hey , you helped them . can you help us ? "
in a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , " How can you do that ?
how can you do - ? " and I said , " I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . "
so - - So the government says , " Do it again . "
we 've done it in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : " planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . "
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
so now you 're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
you have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
local , passionate people . that 's who you have applauded .
so what I 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at .
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
Government ? forget about it !
it will be entrepreneurs , and they 're doing it now .
there 's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
and in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : the city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
they were already drowning in manure .
so 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .
so what happens ? in 40 years ' time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001 .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
otherwise they don 't come and talk to you .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
guess what ?
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
it doesn 't exist .
this person has never been born .
we 've done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson 's autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson 's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word " I " and how many times he uses the word " we . "
never the word " I , " and the word " we " 32 times .
he wasn 't alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , " What do you need ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? "
" Oh , no , I cannot do this . " " would you like me to find you somebody ? "
we activate communities .
we have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
thank you .
Hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria .
with a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to SoundCloud and become famous .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
I 'm a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
let 's go back to that time , to this city .
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
hold it up . an Android , a Blackberry , wow .
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and I will talk about this .
these are 35,830 lines of information .
raw data .
and why are these informations there ?
because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U. Commission tabled a directive .
this directive [ is ] called Data Retention Directive .
this directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
who sends whom a text message ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
all this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider .
and all over Europe , people stood up and said , " We don 't want this . "
they said , we don 't want this data retention .
we want self-determination in the digital age , and we don 't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : " we don 't want this . "
and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said , " Freedom , not fear . "
and some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
and I also ask myself , does it really work ?
can they really store all this information about us ?
every time I use my mobile phone ?
so I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
and I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
but then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are protocoling .
so I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
but Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
so at the end , I had a settlement with them .
I 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional .
so I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside .
and on the C.D. , this was on .
thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
at first I saw it , and I said , okay , it 's a huge file . okay .
but then after a while I realized , this is my life .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
so I was a little bit skeptical , what should I do with it ?
because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
but then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
because I want to show the people what does data retention mean .
so together with Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
you can see every step I take .
and you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne , and how often I call in between .
all this is possible with this information .
that 's a little bit scary .
but it is not only about me .
it 's about all of us .
first , it 's only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
you can see all of this .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
this is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran .
this is a blueprint how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
and this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket .
and the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest , and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
the fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the Iron Curtain .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
but self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
but you have to fight for your self-determination today .
you have to fight for it every day .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it 's not outdated .
when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don 't have to do it .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
so , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .
thank you .
I live in South Central .
this is South Central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city .
this is South Los Angeles .
liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
just like 26.5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the drive-thru and the drive-by .
funny thing is , the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys .
people are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Beverly Hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
and I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks .
and I figured , this has to stop .
so I figured that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn 't impregnated with pesticides .
so what I did , I planted a food forest in front of my house .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
thing is , it 's owned by the city .
but you have to maintain it .
so I 'm like , " Cool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it 's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it . "
and this is how I decided to maintain it .
so me and my group , L.A. Green Grounds , we got together and we started planting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
what we do , we 're a pay-it-forward kind of group , where it 's composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it 's completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
and I 'm like , " Come on , really ?
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? "
and I was like , " Cool . bring it . "
because this time it wasn 't coming up .
so L.A. Times got ahold of it . Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the Green Grounds members , they put up a petition on Change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
we had a victory on our hands .
my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing .
I mean , come on , why wouldn 't they ?
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
that 's 20 Central Parks .
that 's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
when one dollar 's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars ' worth of produce .
it 's my gospel , when I 'm telling people , grow your own food .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
see , I have a legacy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
and I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and I 'm manufacturing my own reality .
see , I 'm an artist .
gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .
just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , I beautiful lawns , parkways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my embellishment for that cloth .
you 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
you just couldn 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
so what happened ?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the soil .
you 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
plus you get strawberries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ashamed .
so I 'm like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don 't have to do this like this .
this is on the street for a reason .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , " Fin , aren 't you afraid people are going to steal your food ? "
and I 'm like , " Hell no , I ain 't afraid they 're gonna steal it .
that 's why it 's on the street .
that 's the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . "
there 's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
so Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
we 've had , like , 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate , and it 's all volunteers .
if kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
but when none of this is presented to them , if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up -- I see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
so with gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next George Washington Carver .
but if we don 't change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
now don 't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
what I 'm talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer 's markets .
so what I want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
so I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .
we gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
if you ain 't a gardener , you ain 't gangsta .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don 't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
one of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is " snollygoster . "
just because it sounds so good .
and what snollygoster means is " a dishonest politician . "
although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , " A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy . "
now I have no idea what " talknophical " is .
something to do with words , I assume .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
it wasn 't until , for example , 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber .
and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby , who took on Parliament .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won .
and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase " as bold as brass . "
most people think that 's down to the metal .
it 's not . it 's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
but to really show you how words and politics interact , I want to take you back to the United States of America , just after they 'd achieved independence .
and they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
they didn 't know .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
and this was debated in Congress for ages and ages .
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
I mean , some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington , and other people , His Highness George Washington , and other people , Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington .
not that catchy .
some people just wanted to call him King .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and they weren 't even being monarchical there , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term .
and , you know , it could have worked .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
I read a diary of this poor senator , who just keeps coming back , " Still on this subject . "
and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate .
the House of Representatives didn 't want Washington to get drunk on power .
they didn 't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
so they wanted to give him the humblest , meagerest , most pathetic title that they could think of .
and that title was " President . "
President . they didn 't invent the title . I mean , it existed before , but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting .
it was like the foreman of the jury .
and it didn 't have much more grandeur than the term " foreman " or " overseer . "
there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
and that 's why the Senate objected to it .
they said , that 's ridiculous , you can 't call him President .
this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries .
and who 's going to take him seriously if he 's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America ?
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the Senate did not cave in .
instead , they agreed to use the title " President " for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn 't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations , whether under republican or monarchical forms of government , whose custom it is to annex , through the office of the Chief Magistrate , titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity , i.e. , we don 't want to look like bloody weirdos .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I 've ever been able to find out , the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President .
Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later .
but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn 't sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
and so the Senate won in the end .
they got their title of respectability .
and also , the Senate 's other worry , the appearance of singularity -- well , it was a singularity back then .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
a hundred and forty-seven .
all because they want to sound like the guy who 's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost , because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
and that 's the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
thank you very much .
so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for Jalalabad as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville , Florida .
I traded my Converse black low-tops for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn 't even see .
and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting , " Down with communism and long live Afghanistan , " and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant .
but this is the geography of self .
and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , redneck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politicized artist who 's been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don 't want to paint rainbows ; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in .
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich .
and where else can the jihadi gangster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : " vote for me ! I 've done jihad , and I 'm rich . "
and try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes .
I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called " Payback " and impersonate a police officer , set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they 'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf .
I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic .
the war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests .
and I 'd like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling 's call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday 's colonial rhetoric about a " white man 's burden " to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit .
but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
that is my burden . what 's yours ?
thank you .
Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I 've been a model .
actually , for 10 years .
and I feel like there 's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
so luckily I brought an outfit change .
this is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
if some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you don 't have to tell me now , but I 'll find out later on Twitter .
I 'd also note that I 'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
not everybody gets to do that .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn 't going to wear them .
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that 's when you 'll all laugh at me , so don 't do anything while it 's over my head .
all right .
so why did I do that ?
that was awkward .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy 's hair .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
and I 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and I always just say , " Oh , I was scouted , " but that means nothing .
the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy .
well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we 're biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin .
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it 's a legacy that I 've been cashing out on .
and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashionistas who are , like , " Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . "
and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white .
the next question people always ask me is , " Can I be a model when I grow up ? "
and the first answer is , " I don 't know , they don 't put me in charge of that . "
but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , " Why ?
you know ? you can be anything .
you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you 'd be the first one . "
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , " No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , " well then I say , " Be my boss . "
because I 'm not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H & amp ; M , or the next Steven Meisel .
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up .
it 's out of your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path .
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now .
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , " Cameron , we want a walking shot , " well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
it will look something like this .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
that was , I don 't know what happened there .
unfortunately after you 've gone to school , and you have a résumé and you 've done a few jobs , you can 't say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your résumé reads , " Underwear Model : 10 years , " people give you a funny look .
the next question people always ask me is , " Do they retouch all the photos ? "
and yeah , they pretty much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what 's happening .
this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it 's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini , and I didn 't even have my period yet .
I know we 're getting personal , but I was a young girl .
this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
my friend got to come with me .
here 's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue .
here 's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
and here 's me today .
and I hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production , and they build this . that 's not me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , " Do you get free stuff ? "
I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that 's what we don 't like to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a " Sorry , officer , " and we were on our way .
and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked , 86 percent of them were black and Latino , and most of them were young men .
and there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York , so for them , it 's not a question of , " Will I get stopped ? "
but " How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? "
when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States , 53 percent don 't like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they 're 17 .
so the last question people ask me is , " What is it like to be a model ? "
and I think the answer that they 're looking for is , " If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . "
and when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
we say , " It 's really amazing to travel , and it 's amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . "
and those things are true , but they 're only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , " I am insecure . "
and I 'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
and if you ever are wondering , " If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair , will I be happier ? "
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they 're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , " Look I 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , " and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , " and it doesn 't always make me happy . "
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
but I 'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it 's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I 'd had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn 't tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn 't tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
if there 's a takeaway to this talk , I hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
thank you .
before March , 2011 , I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City .
we 're pale , gray creatures .
we hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
we make skinny models skinnier , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
on March 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tragic events unfolded in Japan .
soon after , an organization I volunteer with , All Hands Volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn 't just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
on May the 13th , I made my way to the town of Ōfunato .
it 's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
we pulled debris from canals and ditches .
we cleaned schools . we de-mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation .
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
they 'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards .
and everyone was doing the same .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
now , it wasn 't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
at the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
this is where people were handing them in , and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them .
now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and I 've always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn 't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
as I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , I couldn 't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
so that evening , I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
so we started retouching photos .
this was the very first .
not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
otherwise , that little girl isn 't going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that 's as tragic as having the photo damaged .
over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more retouchers were needed , and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I had 150 people wanting to join in .
within Japan , by July , we 'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata , further north to a town called Yamada .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
the older ladies sometimes hadn 't seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it 'd start being fixed .
the time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depended obviously on the damage involved .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
it could take months .
the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn , or pieced together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn 't damaged .
it was very time-consuming .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
we couldn 't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
as my team leader Wynne once said , it 's like doing a tattoo on someone .
you don 't get a chance to mess it up .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
she had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
she also had duplicates .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they 'd recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
one of them got caught up in the water .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
the day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn 't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
after six months in Japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs , the large majority
a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and retouched .
during this time , we hadn 't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
we take photos constantly .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
they 're our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for .
that 's all this project was about , about restoring those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers .
for some of them , it 's given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cindy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
" as I worked , I couldn 't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
across the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren 't they ? "
thank you .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : " son , resist Gaddafi . fight him .
but don 't you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary . "
almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions .
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi .
and there it was , a great revolution .
young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
however , Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
for four decades Gaddafi 's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society .
aware of the devastation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
after a period of 33 years in exile , I went back to Libya , and with unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
with an amazing group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women 's Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women 's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
however , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs .
on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
and every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [ aftermath ] of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
I 'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
we did not prioritize right .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
no , it didn 't .
what is it , then ?
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division .
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
we need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
these are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
for peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
that 's the real zipper .
and we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
according to a Quranic verse " Salam " -- peace -- " is the word of the all-merciful God , raheem . "
in turn , the word " raheem , " which is known in all Abrahamic traditions , has the same root in Arabic as the word " Rahem " -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from .
and so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence .
thus we are told that " My mercy encompasses all things . "
thus we are told that " My mercy takes precedence over my anger . "
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
thank you .
when I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called " Nothing To Envy . "
and I was very proud .
in school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
when I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
but one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister .
it read , " When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven 't eaten for the past two weeks .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . "
I was so shocked .
this was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can 't erase from my memory .
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother 's face .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
a huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't .
this is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
this is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
as you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
but many die .
sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can 't reveal many details [ about ] how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
but I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
in China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it 's not only extremely difficult , it 's also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
so I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
if anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , " This was a false report .
she 's not North Korean . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .
these girls were so lucky .
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
these North Koreans were not so lucky .
every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
it 's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
that 's why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
we are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
am I South Korean or North Korean ?
where am I from ? who am I ?
suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
the North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
they had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
since my family couldn 't speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
he took everyone 's I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
since my family couldn 't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
as the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
we made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .
but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
after I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn 't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
at that moment , I heard one man 's voice ask me , " What 's wrong ? "
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
in my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , " Why are you helping me ? "
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I 'm helping the North Korean people . "
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I 've been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
I 'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
when you see a vulture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . they really do .
and I 'll tell you why .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
when Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , " These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . "
you could not get a worse insult , and that from Charles Darwin .
you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I 'll tell you why .
they 've also be associated with Disney - - personified as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
more recently , if you 've been following the Kenyan press - - these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with . but I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . do you know why ?
because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
they are hardly monogamous .
they are far from being extinct .
and , my favorite is , vultures are better looking .
so there 's two types of vultures in this planet .
there are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the Old World vultures , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
so why are vultures important ? first of all , they provide vital ecological services . they clean up .
they 're our natural garbage collectors .
they clean up carcasses right to the bone .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
they have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt .
in Hindu mythology , Jatayu was the vulture god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana .
in Tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . in places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to cremate them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .
so what is the problem with vultures ?
we have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
the reason is that they 're getting poisoned , and the reason that they 're getting poisoned is because there 's human-wildlife conflicts . the pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
in South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
because there are no vultures , there 's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . they slice them in half .
they are bird-blending machines .
in West Africa , there 's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .
so what 's being done ? well , we 're conducting research on these birds . we 're putting transmitters on them .
we 're trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it 's not going to help you .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
we 're working with local communities .
we 're talking to them about appreciating vultures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
how can you help ? you can become active , make noise . you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . volunteer your time to spread the word . spread the word .
when you walk out of this room , you will be informed about vultures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vultures .
they are very graceful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
Kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
thank you very much .
today I have just one request .
please don 't tell me I 'm normal .
now I 'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
he 's speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
Remi knows what love is .
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't see skin color .
he doesn 't care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
when he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Samuel is 16 . he 's tall . he 's very handsome .
he has the most impeccable memory .
he has a selective one , though .
he doesn 't remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga 's birthday .
don 't they sound incredible ?
but most people don 't agree .
and in fact , because their minds don 't fit into society 's version of normal , they 're often bypassed and misunderstood .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term " autism , " it 's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why Remi is so different from Sam .
and across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it 's one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
and I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
and after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
he screamed a lot .
he didn 't want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn 't seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Remi lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
extraordinary .
now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I 've wished that they were just like me .
but I cast my mind back to the things that they 've taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn 't want to change with normality .
normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
and if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We 've got a gift ! everyone 's got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
please -- don 't tell me I 'm normal .
thank you .
Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple , and exposure just a millionth of a second .
but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
I present you a new type of photography , femto-photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I 'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
how does light look in slow motion ?
now , the whole event
now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond - that 's how much time it takes for light to travel - but I 'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
but , Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research .
now , there 's a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what 's going on .
so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
as you can see , there 's a bubble of air , and it 's bouncing around inside .
meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .
now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you 'll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
it 'll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
and what about some still-life photography ?
you can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
I thought , this is how nature paints a photo , one femto frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn 't become dark .
why is that ? because the tomato is actually ripe , and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trillionths of a second .
so , in the future , when this femto-camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .
so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we 're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you 're going to get hardly any light .
so , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you .
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
so , Superman can fly .
some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
it 's going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
and it 's not science fiction . we have actually built it .
on the left , you see our femto-camera .
there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we 're going to bounce light off the door .
so after our paper was published in Nature Communications , it was highlighted by nature.com , and they created this animation .
we 're going to fire those bullets of light , and they 're going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our femto-camera , it has some unique abilities .
it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn 't really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
can we see it in full 3D ?
so this is our reconstruction .
now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what 's around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders , and also for cardioscopes .
but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra-fast photography , and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we 're collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding , and we look at those ripples . remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second .
but there 's also something funny going on here .
when you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
what 's going on here ?
it turns out , because we 're recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .
so whether it 's for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
it 's about time . thank you .
so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend Jan stripling , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we 're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
but frustratingly , with Parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there 's no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test .
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it 's very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it 's just never done . it 's never done .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
no expensive staff time required .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
so what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan stripling .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOXP2 , for example .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson 's , so too are the vocal organs .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while , and that 's one of the example symptoms of it .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
so these voice-based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we 'll , they 're both non-invasive .
the neurologist 's test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
and they 're both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice-based tests are non-expert .
that means they can be self-administered .
they 're high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
they 're ultra-low cost , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we 're launching the Parkinson 's Voice Initiative .
with Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we 're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
anyone healthy or with Parkinson 's can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I 'm really happy to announce that we 've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
thank you .
so Max , by taking all these samples of , let 's say , 10,000 people , you 'll be able to tell who 's healthy and who 's not ?
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Yeah . Yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
so you 're 86 percent accurate right now ?
it 's much better than that .
actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he 's done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we 're getting 99 percent accuracy .
ninety-nine . well , that 's an improvement .
so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they 're doing in this course of the disease .
absolutely .
thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
thanks , Tom .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
we don 't bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
so over the past few years , I 've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time ?
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans .
my soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees , shading lovers , drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone sneezes , New Orleans has a parade .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I 've had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
but I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it 's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you .
so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence : " before I die , I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
I didn 't know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
and I 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
" before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . "
" before I die , I want to straddle the International Date Line . "
" before I die , I want to sing for millions . "
" before I die , I want to plant a tree . "
" before I die , I want to live off the grid . "
" before I die , I want to hold her one more time . "
" before I die , I want to be someone 's cavalry . "
" before I die , I want to be completely myself . "
so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people 's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they consoled me during my own tough times .
it 's about knowing you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
it 's about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
in our age of increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
death is something that we 're often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but I 've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
thinking about death clarifies your life .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
thank you .
thank you .
this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
those are my dad 's cows at the back , and behind the cows , that 's the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
my community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that 's why we value them so much .
so I grew up hating lions so much .
the morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they 're also upset about this problem .
so they kill the lions .
it 's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad 's cows , and that 's the same thing which happened to me .
so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
but I came to realize that that didn 't really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
so I didn 't give up . I continued .
and a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that I was standing near the cowshed .
but lions are very clever .
they will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they 'll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it 's always here .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
so one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn 't come .
and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so I had an idea .
since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
so I got an old car battery , an indicator box . it 's a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . it blinks .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so I set up everything .
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
thanks .
so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
and I said , " Yes . "
so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
since now , I 've set up seven homes around my community , and they 're really working .
and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it 's also being used to scare elephants away from people 's farms .
because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I 'm really excited about this .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we 're installing the lights to the homes which don 't have [ any ] , and I 'm teaching them how to put them .
so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father 's cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I 'll be there inside .
and here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father 's cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ashê olên . it means in my language , thank you very much .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this scholarship . Yep .
you 're working on other electrical inventions .
what 's the next one on your list ?
my next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
you already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
in the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
we 're going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much . thank you .
photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn 't take any of them .
there were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we 're on the corner of 57th and 5th .
we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
well you can see where this is going .
approaching my daughter 's third birthday , my wife said , " Hey , why don 't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? "
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
no one 's ever refused , and luckily no one 's ever run off with our camera .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
it 's really become sacred to us .
this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
they 're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
and now what she 's looking at in New York are colleges , because she 's determined to go to school in New York .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
I don 't know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I 'm not in many of the family photos .
I 'm always the one taking the picture .
so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don 't hesitate to go up to someone and ask , " Will you take our picture ? "
thank you .
